                  in order to decouple applications and data use?</dt>
                <dd>The Linked Data Notifications protocol separates the concerns between applications <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em>, and <em>consumers</em> of notifications. Such decoupling of application roles in context of a clientâ€“server model can be interoperable between two classes of interactions, <a href="#sender-to-receiver">senders and receivers</a>, or between <a href="#consumer-to-receiver">consumers and receivers</a>. These are atomic interactions in that they facilitate the design of loosely-coupled systems that can exchange structured notifications. For instance, the fact that a receiver application is only responsible to take in and serve notifications entails that independently implemented applications are free to focus at minimum on assembling and distributing notifications, or obtaining and re-using notifications. As such, the LDN protocol affords a high <a href="linked-data-notifications#degree-of-control-in-ldn">degree of control</a> to actors in that they can use their preferred applications, store notifications where they prefer, switch between applications without relocating the notification, and relocate the notifications without having to change applications. LDN's underlying mechanism triggers <em>registration</em>, fulfills <em>awareness</em>, and can support fulfilling the <em>certification</em> and <em>archiving</em> <a href="linked-data-notifications#ldn-forces-functions">functions in scientific communication</a> in a decentralised ecosystem.</dd>

              LD publishing scales in terms of a paygo approach eg. socially-aware application, ldn test suite/spec..
              LD approach evidently satisfies the FAIR principles out of the box.
              Creating and consuming human- and machine-readable Web resources is feasible.
              Mechanisms for decentralisation and interoperability makes (may make?) RACA-Aware App easier to work with. At least decoupled.

              "Third-party" publishers are not required. If anything, generally limits or has constraints on what and how Web resources can be published.

<p>Linked Research and dokieli is closely aligned with the original concept of <q cite="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/pg01unesco.html">self-archiving</q> - Ginsparg "school of thought", provided that anyone can share their Web resources from where they prefer.</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Perspectives</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>Given our half a millennia of experience of mass print publishing, and half a century on electronic publishing, we are in a position to situate, examine and question our assumptions as to what constitutes scholarly knowledge exchange and participation in context of the Web. For instance, the Web - a <em>read-write</em> space - inherently enables anyone to be a "publisher" where each researcher can exercise their full creativity and expression without being subject to external constraints. With the exception where a third-party entity permits the level of expression that the knowledge creator can potentially seek, such external participants are subject to set technical constraints on the notion to shape content. Yet, third-party involvement, typically through for-profit service providers in conjunction with academic institutions and libraries, influence the quality and availability of publicly-funded research output and exchange. The social and professional incentives for academics can be traced to the workflows exerted by external forces.</p>

              <p>If scholarly communication is predominately and increasingly driven by the Web, how can we approach the integration of scholarly processes with the inherent properties of the Web? One way to look at this is by examining history: the printing press played a major role in moving the non-literate public to learn to read and write for themselves. Given the Web, we find ourselves in a similar situation, with different modes of communication. In order to use the Web effectively - as far as taking advantage of its built-in characteristics, the research community essentially needs to better position itself to self-publish and disseminate their knowledge, as well as be more attributable and accountable in their social engagement. This kind of ongoing evolution is vital for the advancement of scholarly communication. Moving towards Web-centric information flows and participation requires the scholarly ecosystem to unchain itself from historic practices.</p>

              <p>This thesis posited, and to some extent postulated that knowledge creators can demonstrate that self-publishing different units of communication can be socially, technically, and financially preferable to a third-party's handling of the same information and interactions, as well as their reuse. <q>Control yourself</q> captures the idea that autonomous, decentralised participation in the scholarly ecosystem is possible and desirable. Web technologies enable universal accessibility of units of information that are human- and machine-readable, as well as the possibility to integrate social interactions with scholarly information.</p>


              <p>Science and innovation is driven by social and technological development. until the telescope, microscope... was invented, we were limited to our observations. what would a "AI-driven" technology enable us?</p>

              Scholarly community should opt for <a href="#contextual-citations">contextual citations</a> (with semantically typed relations) when connecting specific units of informations. This has the potential to advance biblio/citation metrics - I'd argue that document-level metrics has information loss, since it does not preserve authors' 1) intended connection between units of information, 2) reason for the connection.

              better connection of knowledge goals with potential solutions
              querying for survey results (instead of human-reading/parsing/interpretation)
              reusing / extending test suites and data cubes eg. quality attributes, FAIR metrics, Specs for RACA
              DRY eg. WebID Profile description
              querying of research problems (where others have left off)

                <p>What would you do differently next time? How do your findings generalize to to other domains? What impact can this have (this is minimally stated) and why? What is needed/still needs to be done to have such an impact?</p>



                <p id="social-implications"><strong>Social Implications</strong>:
* social consequences of open science
** media pushed to the extreme (mcluhan) - global fight

<p id="general-principle-of-control"><strong>General Principle of Control</strong>: In an ecosystem where anyone can (technically) say anything about anything, we acknowledge the social challenges surrounding that. For instance, systems are not immune to negative information created and distributed by actors. While the challenges are inherently domain agnostic, it is important for academic and research communication even if individual or institutional accountability and reputation is at stake. While building and maintaining a positive Web-centric scholarly system is beyond the scope of this thesis, we can keep bear in mind the social implications of our architectural and design decisions, in order to increase the value and incentives to participate in such systems. Discuss https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli/issues/152 and refer back to minor discussion on linked-data-notifications#social-implications</p>


In context of major communication shifts, we have not scratched the surface - 30 years into the advent of the Web is till a very brief period in history.

* what roles could libraries/institutions play? eg notify about article/review
* institutional repositories like eprints then they buy PURE from Springer.
* ldprints</p>

<p id="role-of-authentication-capabilities">Used WebID-TLS first.. and then had to adopt to WebID-OIDC. Decentralised authentication mechanisms is vital.</p>

<p id="privacy-aware-information-space"><strong>Privacy Aware Information Spaces</strong>: Actors can better make decisions if their applications are privacy-aware, for example through ODRLs.. We should also observe the interplay of forces and functions in scholarly communication to see how privacy-aware applications may materialise new forms of content and interactions.</p>
</section>

<p>Designing other RACA-Aware decentralised applications.. how can we remix specs to address other/new problems?</p>

<p> What has it shaped? What are the current challenges? How do we envision the communication to be? How can we use the medium better whether through its original intentions or new?</p>

<p>Personal On-Demand Archiving Services. Storage?</p>

<p>browsers should be Linked Data aware to enable smarter applications. right now each application has to include LD-know-how to take more advantage of the Web. if browsers natively supported those features, we can create advance the quality of applications.</p>

<p>We can indeed navigate through specific units of information as well as search and query.</p>

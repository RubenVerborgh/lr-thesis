              <p>The sections <cite><a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web">Scholarly Communication on the Web</a></cite>, <cite><a href="structure-of-scholarly-information">Structure of Scholarly Information</a></cite>, and <cite><a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication">Decentralising Scholarly Communication</a></cite> served to explain the state of sociotechnical affairs in scholarly communication, as well as to identify knowledge gaps by answering the <a href="introduction#knowledge-questions">knowledge questions</a> in order to address the <a href="introduction#technical-research-problems">technical research problems</a>. In this section I will review how the technical research problems have been answered.</p>

                <dt id="technical-research-problems-mechanisms-review">What technical mechanisms, standards or protocols can be employed for decentralised information exchange on the Web?</dt>
                <dd>Linked Data Notifications is a communication protocol that describes how applications can perform the roles of <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em>, and <em>consumers</em> when exchanging notifications. Such decoupling of application roles in context of a clientâ€“server model permits interoperability between two classes of interactions, senders and receivers, or between consumers and receivers. These are atomic interactions in that they facilitate the design of loosely coupled systems that can exchange structured notifications as Linked Data. As such, the LDN protocol affords a high <a href="linked-data-notifications#degree-of-control-in-ldn">degree of control</a> to actors in that they can use their preferred applications, store notifications where they prefer, switch between applications without relocating the notifications, and relocate the notifications without having to change applications. LDN's underlying mechanism triggers <em>registration</em>, fulfills <em>awareness</em>, and can support fulfilling the <em>certification</em> and <em>archiving</em> <a href="linked-data-notifications#ldn-forces-functions">functions in scientific communication</a> in a decentralised ecosystem.</dd>

                <dt id="technical-research-problems-artefacts-review">How can Web technologies be employed to fulfil the core functions of scholarly communication in an open and interoperable way?</dt>
                <dd>A decentralised client application based on the <cite>Open Web Platform</cite> can be devised to allow independent actors to exchange units of communication with decentralised storage services. <cite>dokieli</cite> demonstrates how an assembly of Web standards can come together in a cohesive way in order to enable actors to reach a high <a href="decentralised-linked-research-application#degree-of-control-in-dokieli">degree of control</a> over their creations and social activities. HTTP is used to perform CRUD operations, (HTTP) URIs to identify Web resources, and Linked Data design principles to uniformly represent, link, and discover information. Actors can identify themselves through WebID (HTTP URI) whether tied to a real or fictitious entity, extend their profile descriptions, and authenticate against servers with mechanisms like WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. Machine-interpretable profile descriptions also enables the client application to adapt to accommodate actor's capabilities. It is feasible to create and consume human- <em>and</em> machine-readable units of (scholarly) communication using standards such as RDFa in HTML, and be combined with other RDF serialisations based on technical specifications. A variety of Linked Data vocabularies can be used for semantic content authoring. The Linked Data Notifications protocol is used to exchange structured notifications. The Web Annotation Data Model and Protocol is used to associate resources and exchange annotations. The ActivityPub protocol is used to exchange social activities. The resources that dokieli generates are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by other standards-compliant Linked Data applications. The resulting technical design operates under the notion of a scholarly ecosystem where other applications can be decoupled to fulfill the registration, awareness, certification, and archiving <a href="decentralised-linked-research-application#dokieli-forces-functions">functions in scholarly communication</a>.</dd>
              </dl>

              <p>In summary, Linked Data Notifications is a building block for diverse decentralised and loosely coupled Web applications to exchange notifications, and fulfills the <em>awareness</em> function in scholarly communication. dokieli demonstrates how <abbr title="Registration, Awareness, Certification, Archiving">RACA</abbr>-aware Linked Data applications can be designed while fulfilling essential <cite><a href="decentralised-linked-research-application#requirements-decentralised-web-publishing">decentralised Web publishing</a></cite> requirements.</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Interpretations</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>In this section I reflect on what the findings of this thesis can mean to us and why we should care.</p>

              <p id="paygo-linked-data"><strong>PAYGO Linked Data</strong>: Publishing units of communication by following the Linked Data principles is similar to the <cite><a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#paygo">pay as you go</a></cite> approach in dataspace systems in that knowledge on the Web can be extended incrementally without having everything up front or even a commitment to do so. This is particularly evident when disparate collection of units (or graphs) published by different entities can be connected when they share globally identifiable entities, as well as being universally useful when the content they identify is accessible.</p>

              <p id="fair-linked-data"><strong>FAIR Linked Data</strong>: For openly accessible resources, I note that the <cite><a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#linked-data">Linked Data</a></cite> approach and technology stack can fulfill <cite><a hef="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#fair-guiding-principles">FAIR guiding principles</a></cite>. One generalisation that could be made from this is that Linked Data design principles can be adopted as a base requirement when building interoperable Web applications, which would also fulfill FAIR. After all, the FAIR principles does not prescribe the mechanisms for Web data, and as such, interoperability across applications for independently produced FAIR-conformance is not systematically guaranteed. In contrast, the Linked Data approach specifies the mechanisms within the framework of the <cite><a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#architecture-of-the-web">architecture of the Web</a></cite> and guarantees interop.</p>

              <p id="decentralised-identity-and-authentication"><strong>Decentralised Identity and Authentication</strong>: Applications primarily operate in a read-only information space in the absence of decentralised identities and authentication mechanisms. Client applications can be loosely coupled with servers when the source of authentication is distributed. Actors can use independently built client applications to perform CRUD operations provided that they can authenticate using their preferred WebID, as well as have the possibility to decide on the storage location of their data. Thus, it is possible to distribute scholarly contributions on the Web based on an actor (or contributor) centric model.</p>

              <p id="interoperable-applications"><strong>Interoperable Applications</strong>: Decoupling of the forces and functions in scholarly communication in context of the Web necessitates interoperable applications through the use of standard data formats and communication protocols. These class of applications need to only reflect user's intent within the frame of a loosely coupled system design. That is, applications having semantic understanding of the affordances of the system makes it possible to automate information exchange. Consequently enabling users to switch between standards-compliant applications without interfering with existing data. For instance, HTTP, URI, and HTML are widely used standards on the Web enabling us to use any user agent (like a Web browser) on the Open Web Platform. Similarly, one layer up on the interoperability ladder would be to employ communication protocols and data formats that are capable of addressing specific use cases.</p>

              <p class="sociotechnical-centralisation"><strong>Sociotechnical Centralisation</strong>: We can observe different forms of centralisation within decentralisation. As we adopt mechanisms with the intention of decentralisation and interoperability, are we free of all forms of centralisation and vendor lock-ins? For instance, <cite><a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#uri-ownership">URI Ownership</a></cite> discussed the inherent social centralisation of DNS in that individuals merely rent domain names from registrars and maintain the mapping to physical servers. <cite><a href="linked-data-notifications#semantic-organisation-of-notifications">Semantic Organisation of Notifications</a></cite> highlights one form of organic centralisation around the choice of Linked Data vocabularies that the applications make use of. Technical Web specifications for the most part reflect the group's goals, cultural norms or biases. For instance, LDN was initially incubated in the <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid project</a> within the understanding of a socially-aware read-write Linked Data paradigm, and then developed to be a technical specification through the W3C <abbr title="Social Web Working Group">SWWG</abbr> as part of a broader context of decentralisation efforts.</p>

              <p id="aaa-raca"><strong>AAA in RACA</strong>: <cite><a href="#function-of-peer-review">Function of Peer Review</a></cite> noted the intentions and limits of peer-review in context of the Web. It is neither the case that the right, the privilege, or the practice of the notion <q><a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#aaa">anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</a></q> is exempt from ethical considerations. As we have seen in modern Web social media, management and distribution of misinformation and disinformation is profitable and poses a danger to civilisation. For instance, as electronic publication has also been blurring the lines between academic work and personal opinions, making the distinction between the two as part of the scientific endeavour has only become more vital. In that respect, the notion of <cite><a href="linked-research#self-publishing">self-publishing</a></cite> does not entail quality-controlled and certified units of communication in and itself, but rather focuses on increasing actors' immediate role and control. Thus, trust and accountability remain as social processes.</p>

              <p id="school-of-thought"><strong>School of Thought</strong>: Some of dokieli's design decisions were driven by the need to enable actors to autonomously participate in a decentralised scholarly ecosystem. With respect to the four functions in scientific communication, the expectations are to operate under a <em>deconstructed</em> or <em>decoupled</em> model while providing high degree of control to content creators and consumers, as well as generating and reusing interoperable data. This approach shares some conceptual similarities to the <q cite="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/pg01unesco.html">self-archiving</q> approach in that scholars have the right to freely share their Web resources from open repositories. However, a distinction between the <q>self-archiving</q> initiative and <cite><a href="linked-research#self-publishing">self-publishing</a></cite> in context of the <cite><a href="linked-research">Linked Research</a></cite> goal can be made in that while an actor may prefer to share their contributions through third-party controlled components, the baseline for <q>self-publishing</q> is that they are not required to. Thus, the network location and the applications that are used to make the content available are orthogonal to the notion of what constitutes a scholarly contribution. Lastly, parallel characteristics between dokieli's approach and the <cite><a href="linked-research#republic-of-letters">Republic of Letters</a></cite> can be made in that both operate under the idea of scholarly activities to be a researcher-centric model - direct information exchange between authors and readers - without requiring intermediaries.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p id="sociotechnical-advancement"><strong>Sociotechnical Advancement</strong>: Given our half a millennia of experience in mass print publishing, and half a century on electronic publishing, we are in a position to situate, examine and question our assumptions as to what constitutes scholarly knowledge exchange and participation in context of the Web. If scholarly communication is predominately and increasingly driven by the Web, how can we approach the integration of scholarly processes with the inherent properties of the Web? One way to look at this is by <a href="linked-research#the-printing-press-as-an-agent-of-change">examining history</a>: the printing press played a major role in moving the non-literate public to learn to read and write for themselves. Given the Web, we find ourselves in a similar situation with different modes of communication. For instance, the Web - an environment for simultaneous "read" and "write" operations on hypermedia - inherently enables anyone to be a "publisher", where each actor can exercise their full creativity and ability to express the shape of their content. In order to use the Web effectively - as far as taking advantage of its built-in characteristics, the research community needs to better position itself to self-publish and disseminate their knowledge, as well as be more attributable and accountable in their social engagement. This kind of ongoing evolution is necessary for the advancement of scholarly communication and consequently the society. Moving towards Web-centric information flow requires the scholarly ecosystem to unchain itself from antiquated practices and inadequate use of the available medium. In context of major communication shifts, we have not scratched the surface - 30 years into the advent of the Web is still a very brief period in history.</p>

              <p id="addressing-social-implications"><strong>Addressing Social Implications</strong>: <cite><a href="linked-data-notifications#social-implications">Social Implications of LDN</a></cite> looked at a particular area of design considerations for notifications. <cite><a href="decentralised-linked-research-application#activities">dokieli's Activities</a></cite> describes how a "friend of a friend" social network can work. An AAA-based ecosystem while can potentially enable everyone to voice themselves, the Web is not immune to the distribution of disinformation or cyberbullying. How can we cultivate positive behaviour, and designing systems to discover and filter content based on personal preferences or community norms? Thus, in context of <cite><a href="#decentralised-linked-research-application#requirements-decentralised-web-publishing">decentralised Web publishing</a></cite>, future research can investigate:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>How can harassment and abuse be prevented or handled?</li>
                <li>How would moderation or civil discourse work?</li>
                <li>How can a resource prohibit or consent to be annotated at fine granularity?</li>
                <li>How can the conditions to annotate and notify be indicated and monitored?</li>
                <li>How can a resource's annotation policy and rules be respected?</li>
                <li>What may be the conditions to associate different identities?</li>
                <li>How can domain expertise be factored in?</li>
              </ul>

              <p id="extended-profiles"><strong>Extended Profiles</strong>: WebID Profile descriptions can be extended to enable richer decentralised clientside applications in that both the user interface and the content can be a reflection of actor's preferences and abilities. What kinds of "preference negotiation" can be made?</p>

              <p id="privacy-aware-information-space"><strong>Privacy Aware Information Spaces</strong>: Actors can be better supported in their decision-making if their applications are privacy-aware and respecting, for example through the use of standards like <abbr title="Open Digital Rights Language">ODRL</abbr>. This leads to the possibility of observing the interplay of forces and functions in scholarly communication, and in particular, how privacy-aware applications can generate and consume new forms of content and interactions. How can a decentralised ecosystem balance privacy, integrity and availability?</p>

              <p id="lossless-citations"><strong>Lossless Citations</strong>: Applications supporting semantic content authoring enables fine-grained connections to be created between units of communication. Approaches like in <cite><a href="#contextual-citations">contextual citations</a></cite> (with semantically typed relations) make it possible to preserve authors' intended connection between units of communication. Further study on creating, annotating, as well as extracting citation Linked Data can provide further insights into (scholarly) content. How can open research questions be systematically discovered by machines?</p>

              <p id="raca-aware-applications"><strong>RACA-Aware Applications</strong>: <cite><a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#forces-and-functions-in-specifications">Forces and Functions in Specifications</a></cite> characterised open Web protocols, standards, and models in context of scholarly communication. While this contribution is not intended to be a complete collection of approaches, future work can extend the current <a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#characteristics-of-specifications">RDF Data Cube dataset</a> and the EARL results including additional subjects with new observations. The availability of such structured dataset can help answering the knowledge questions of future research when designing "<dfn id="raca-aware">RACA-Aware</dfn>" decentralised and interoperable applications. Thus, potentially answering a research question along the lines of <em>How can we systematically remix open Web specifications in order to design RACA-Aware applications?</em> Another area of research would be for applications to systematically and adaptively determine, as well as apply the right abstraction level for content based on actor's needs.</p>

              <p id="on-demand-archiving"><strong>On-Demand Archiving</strong>: While there are publicly usable on-demand archiving services eg. Internet Archive, there is a need for client applications to be able to both choose from existing archiving services as well as allow users to specify their preferred services when making <em>contextual citations</em> or archiving any unit of communication. To that end, future research can investigate how personal or community-controlled archiving services can be designed in order to enable decentralised client applications.</p>

              <p id="linked-data-aware-user-agents"><strong>Linked Data-Aware User Agents</strong>: At the moment, common user agents like the Web browser are not natively equipped to parse and re-serialise data expressed with the RDF language, or have the ability to construct SPARQL queries and process query results, yet alone adapt the user interface based on content. Consequently, client applications and Web Extensions are forced to include (JavaScript) code libraries to handle these futures until there is built-in support. Such method of inclusions increases the complexity of using as well as maintaining the libraries. Future research can investigate effective ways to natively integrate RDF and SPARQL libraries and support corresponding APIs in the Web browser so that client applications can focus on higher-level user intentions as opposed to lower-level data management.</p>

              <p id="third-parties-considered-harmful"><strong>Third-Parties Considered Harmful</strong>: The current state of scholarly communication on the Web is ravelled with sociotechnical limits and complications. The overarching technical research problem aimed to investigate and design Web-centric artefacts that would enable content creators and consumers to have more control over their activities, as well as to effectively exchange information. The Web continues to enable anyone to be a "publisher". The findings of thesis reveals that third-party "publishers" are not required and that <a href="#requirements-decentralised-web-publishing">decentralised Web publishing</a> is feasible <em>for everyone</em>.</p>

          <hr />

          <p id="to-boldly-go-where-we-have-not-gone-before"><strong>To boldly go where we have not gone before</strong>: I contend that one way to advance scholarly communication <em>on the Web</em>, social policies need to accurately reflect the affordances of the media. The Linked Research initiative ironically indicates the need for a counter-environment as a means of practising the dominant and unnoticed environment, that is the Web as a communication medium. The social conventions that surrounds the notion of a "scholarly contribution" should be revisited in order to improve the accessibility of knowledge, and be more inclusive and equitable for everyone. The evolution of sociotechnical systems require people's adaptability at the same time. In order for the scholarly ecosystem to be genuinely "open" and inclusive, systems need to interoperate based on the notion of a universal design - actor diversity with variations in needs, capabilities, and aspirations.</p>

          <p>I propose the notion of <cite><a href="linked-research">Linked Research</a></cite> as a potentially useful shared paradigm for scholarly activities on the Web. You are cordially invited to <em>self-publish</em> and share your activities related to any unit of significance in this thesis.</p>

          <p>So there we have it. It is all very simple.</p>

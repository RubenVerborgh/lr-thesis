                  in order to decouple applications and data use?</dt>
                <dd>Linked Data Notifications is a communication protocol that describes how applications can perform the roles of <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em>, and <em>consumers</em> when exchanging notifications. Such decoupling of application roles in context of a clientâ€“server model permits interoperability between two classes of interactions, senders and receivers, or between consumers and receivers. These are atomic interactions in that they facilitate the design of loosely-coupled systems that can exchange structured notifications as Linked Data. As such, the LDN protocol affords a high <a href="linked-data-notifications#degree-of-control-in-ldn">degree of control</a> to actors in that they can use their preferred applications, store notifications where they prefer, switch between applications without relocating the notifications, and relocate the notifications without having to change applications. LDN's underlying mechanism triggers <em>registration</em>, fulfills <em>awareness</em>, and can support fulfilling the <em>certification</em> and <em>archiving</em> <a href="linked-data-notifications#ldn-forces-functions">functions in scientific communication</a> in a decentralised ecosystem.</dd>

                <dd>A decentralised client application based on the <cite>Open Web Platform</cite> can be devised to allow independent actors to exchange units of communication with decentralised storage services. <cite>dokieli</cite> demonstrates how an assembly of Web standards can come together in a cohesive way in order to enable actors to reach a high <a href="decentralised-linked-research-application#degree-of-control-in-dokieli">degree of control</a> over their creations and social activities. HTTP is used to perform CRUD operations, (HTTP) URIs to identify Web resources, and Linked Data design principles to uniformly represent, link, and discover information. Actors can identify themselves through WebID (HTTP URI) whether tied to a real or fictitious entity, extend their profile descriptions, and authenticate against servers with mechanisms like WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. Machine-interpretable profile descriptions also enables the client application to adapt to accommodate actor's capabilities. It is feasible to create and consume human- <em>and</em> machine-readable units of (scholarly) communication using standards such as RDFa in HTML, and be combined with other RDF serialisations based on technical specifications. A variety of Linked Data vocabularies can be used for semantic content authoring. The Linked Data Notifications protocol is used to exchange structured notifications. The Web Annotation Data Model and Protocol is used to associate resources and exchange annotations. The ActivityPub protocol is used to exchange social activities. The resources that dokieli generates are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by other standards-compliant Linked Data applications. The resulting technical design operates under the notion of a scholarly ecosystem where other applications can be decoupled to fulfill the registration, awareness, certification, and archiving <a href="decentralised-linked-research-application#dokieli-forces-functions">functions in scholarly communication</a>.</dd>
              </dl>

              <p>In summary, Linked Data Notifications is a building block for diverse decentralised and loosely coupled Web applications to exchange notifications, and fulfills the <em>awareness</em> function in scholarly communication. dokieli demonstrates how RACA-aware Linked Data applications can be designed while fulfilling essential decentralised <cite><a href="decentralised-linked-research-application#requirements-web-publishing">Web publishing</a></cite> requirements.</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Interpretations</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>In this section I reflect on what the findings of this thesis can mean to us and why we should care.</p>

              <p id="paygo-linked-data"><strong>PAYGO Linked Data</strong>: Publishing units of communication by following the Linked Data principles is similar to the <cite><a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#paygo">pay as you go</a></cite> approach in dataspace systems that knowledge on the Web can be extended incrementally, without having everything up front or even a commitment to do so. This is particularly evident when disparate collection of units (or graphs) published by different entities can be connected when they share globally identifiable entities, as well as being universally useful when the content they identify is accessible.</p>

              <p id="fair-linked-data"><strong>FAIR Linked Data</strong>: For openly accessible resources, I note that the <cite><a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#linked-data">Linked Data</a></cite> approach and technology stack can fulfill <cite><a hef="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#fair-guiding-principles">FAIR guiding principles</a></cite>. One generalisation that could be made from this is that Linked Data design principles can be adopted as a base requirement when building interoperable Web applications, which would also fulfill FAIR. After all, the FAIR principles does not prescribe the mechanisms for the Web, whereas the Linked Data approach does within the framework of the <cite><a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#architecture-of-the-web">architecture of the Web</a></cite>.</p>

              <p id="decentralised-identity-and-authentication"><strong>Decentralised Identity and Authentication</strong>: Without decentralised identities and authentication mechanisms, applications primarily operate in a read-only information space. While it is possible to perform write operations without requiring authentication and authorization, eg. sending a notification to an inbox, there are use cases that require authentication and authorization. Moreover, what stems from distributing the source of authentication is that client applications can be loosely coupled with servers and data. Exemplar applications like dokieli show that actors can use similar client application to perform CRUD operations provided that they can authenticate using their preferred WebID, as well as have the possibility to decide on the location of their data on the Web. Thus, it is possible to distribute scholarly communication on the Web through an actor-centric model without requiring intermediary parties.</p>

              <p class="sociotechnical-centralisation"><strong>Sociotechnical Centralisation</strong>: We can observe different forms of centralisation within decentralisation. As we adopt mechanisms with the intention of decentralisation and interoperability, are we free of all forms of centralisation and vendor lock-ins? The answer may depend on the layer that the conversation takes place in and the observable effects of degree of control actors have. <cite><a href="linked-data-notifications#semantic-organisation-of-notifications">Semantic Organisation of Notification</a></cite> highlights one form of organic centralisation around the choice of Linked Data vocabularies that the applications make use of based on social needs. Similarly, technical Web specifications for the most part are written by those that "show up", and naturally the outcome reflects the group's cultural norms or biases. The design decisions are not done in a vacuum even if they are technically sound, but technical soundness or completeness is not an ultimatum. For instance, LDN was initially incubated in the <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid project</a> and then developed to be a technical specification through the W3C <abbr title="Social Web Working Group">SWWG</abbr> as part of a broader context of decentralisation efforts.</p>

              <p id="aaa-raca"><strong>AAA in RACA</strong>: <cite><a href="#function-of-peer-review">Function of Peer Review</a></cite> noted the intentions and limits of peer-review in context of the Web. It is neither the case that the right, the privilege and the practice of the notion <q><a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#aaa">anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</a></q> is exempt from ethical considerations. As we have seen in modern Web social media, management and distribution of misinformation is profitable and poses a danger to civilisation. For instance, as electronic publication has also been blurring the lines between academic work and personal opinions, making the distinction between the two as part of the scientific endeavour has only become more vital. In that respect, the notion of <cite><a href="linked-research#self-publishing">self-publishing</a></cite> does not entail accessibility of certified units of communication. The quality-control and certification awarded by the scientific or scholarly community, as well as the society applies to self-publishing as usual.</p>

              <p id="raca-aware-applications"><strong>RACA-Aware Applications</strong>: What dokieli </p>


              <p id="school-of-thought"><strong>School of Thought</strong>: Some of the dokieli's design decisions were driven by the need to enable actors to autonomously participate in a decentralised scholarly ecosystem. With respect to the four functions in scientific communication, the expectations are to operate under a decoupled model while providing high degree of control to content creators and consumers, as well as generating and reusing interoperable data. This viewpoint can be closely aligned with the original <q cite="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/pg01unesco.html">self-archiving</q> "school of thought" in that scholars have the right to freely share their Web resources from open repositories, which is one of the strategies implemented by the Open Access movement. However, a distinction between the <q>self-archiving</q> initiative and <cite><a href="linked-research#self-publishing">self-publishing</a></cite> in context of the <cite><a href="linked-research">Linked Research</a></cite> goal can be made in that, while an actor may prefer to share their contributions through third-party controlled components, the baseline <q>self-publishing</q> is that, they are not required to. Thus, the network location and the applications that are used make the content available are orthogonal to the notion of what constitutes a scholarly contribution.</p>

          <section id="perspectives" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#perspectives">
            <h2 property="schema:name">Perspectives</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>Given our half a millennia of experience of mass print publishing, and half a century on electronic publishing, we are in a position to situate, examine and question our assumptions as to what constitutes scholarly knowledge exchange and participation in context of the Web. For instance, the Web - a <em>read-write</em> space - inherently enables anyone to be a "publisher" where each researcher can exercise their full creativity and expressing the shape of their content. In contrast, third-party involvement, typically through for-profit service providers in conjunction with academic institutions and libraries, influence the quality and availability of publicly-funded research output and exchange.</p>

              <p>If scholarly communication is predominately and increasingly driven by the Web, how can we approach the integration of scholarly processes with the inherent properties of the Web? One way to look at this is by <a href="linked-research#the-printing-press-as-an-agent-of-change">examining history</a>: the printing press played a major role in moving the non-literate public to learn to read and write for themselves. Given the Web, we find ourselves in a similar situation with different modes of communication. In order to use the Web effectively - as far as taking advantage of its built-in characteristics, the research community essentially needs to better position itself to self-publish and disseminate their knowledge, as well as be more attributable and accountable in their social engagement. This kind of ongoing evolution is vital for the advancement of scholarly communication. Moving towards Web-centric information flows and participation requires the scholarly ecosystem to unchain itself from historic practices.</p>

              <p>This thesis posited, and to some extent postulated that knowledge creators can demonstrate that self-publishing different units of communication can be socially, technically, and financially preferable to third-parties handling of the same information and interactions, as well as their reuse. Autonomous participation in the scholarly ecosystem is technically possible and arguably ethically preferable. Web technologies enable universal accessibility of units of information that are human- and machine-readable, as well as the possibility to integrate social interactions with scholarly information.</p>


              <p>Science and innovation is driven by social and technological development. until the telescope, microscope... was invented, we were limited to our observations. what would a "AI-driven" technology enable us?</p>

              Scholarly community should opt for <a href="#contextual-citations">contextual citations</a> (with semantically typed relations) when connecting specific units of informations. This has the potential to advance biblio/citation metrics - I'd argue that document-level metrics has information loss, since it does not preserve authors' 1) intended connection between units of information, 2) reason for the connection.

              better connection of knowledge goals with potential solutions
              querying for survey results (instead of human-reading/parsing/interpretation)
              reusing / extending test suites and data cubes eg. quality attributes, FAIR metrics, Specs for RACA
              DRY eg. WebID Profile description
              querying of research problems (where others have left off)

                <p>In <a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web">scholarly communication on the Web</a>, I discuss the effects of the printing press on society from the point of McLuhan's theory on the effects of media and Kuhn's scientific paradigm shifts.</p>

Thus, we need to be mindful of the social and scholarly systems we design within the framework of AAA.

<p id="general-principle-of-control"><strong>General Principle of Control</strong>: In an ecosystem where anyone can (technically) say anything about anything, we acknowledge the social challenges surrounding that. For instance, systems are not immune to negative information created and distributed by actors. While the challenges are inherently domain agnostic, it is important for academic and research communication even if individual or institutional accountability and reputation is at stake. While building and maintaining a positive Web-centric scholarly system is beyond the scope of this thesis, we can keep bear in mind the social implications of our architectural and design decisions, in order to increase the value and incentives to participate in such systems.

              "Third-party" publishers are not required. If anything, generally limits or has constraints on what and how Web resources can be published.

In light of existing scholarly publishing practices, I contend that third-party publishers are not required especially in context of the Web. After all, on the Web, anyone can technically be a publisher. This, the social conventions that surrounds the notion of a scholarly contribution should be revisited.

              <p id="information-society">I live in an <q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_society">information society</a></q>, which makes use of variety of communication media to meet societal needs. The Web has shaped social policies and practices around the world, as well as influence the creation and use of other technologies. It has also reconfigured individuals to be active participants in global information exchange, as well as passive consumers partly due to the abundance of instantaneously accessible multimedia. To date - 30 years old as of this writing - the Web has served for "good" and "evil". Like any human technology, what we devise and how we use them has societal implications.</p>

              <p id="the-story">We can start this story from anywhere. I argue that in order to best contextualise this thesis, it is essential to operate under the understanding of communication mediums and scientific revolutions, as well as their effects on society. This is especially because the research goals of this thesis at its core is socio-technical, and that a clear division between them will not do its justice. One overarching goal is to foster the social machinery from different perspectives that is required to build a knowledge Web for any type of user; human or machine. While I set the problem context to scholarly communication, applications of the knowledge and generated artefacts are potentially applicable to other initiatives in society.</p>

              <p id="assumptions">I assume that researchers in scholarly communication are motivated to some extent personally, whether that is with the goal to take part in advancing collective knowledge, society and life, career advancement, prestige, or financial gain. Researchers are intrinsically interested in making their impact by way of sharing their findings in manner that is most accessible to potential users. As for the underlying technical machinery for information exchange, I assume that it is useful to aim in designing interoperable information systems to help us address problems in context of societal goals. All of these aspects are part of the "social machine" of scholarly communication, and are explored through the sections.</p>

              <p id="up-next">As many have argued, for scholarly communication to be more effective; accessible, usable, inclusive, as well as equitable, we need to adopt methods that are better at identifying and making use of the native affordances of the Web. This is particularly important since academic and social activities use the Web as the primary medium to communicate (in contrast to systems that mimic paper media). Hence, I examine the core characteristics of the Web, discuss the state of affairs in scholarly communication, and share my findings in the ways that the latter can satisfy the forces and functions in scientific communication.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>In research projects, there are various stakeholders acting as internal and external forces in scholarly communication. In order to address societal concerns, research sponsors fund projects to attain reusable technical designs and acquire new knowledge in the process. Knowledge workers like researchers and scholars are driven by curiosity to advance our understanding of the universe. The public is interested in accessing applications of research to educate and for the well-being of life. The industry needs efficient functioning of scientific communication in order to translate the return of research capital.</p>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Problem Context</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>There are several sociotechnical limitations in the contemporary paradigm that the scholarly communication operates in. I will summarise a subset of problem areas relating to interoperability and autonomy. Each problem space will be further explored in relevant sections of this thesis.</p>

                  <p>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover and build new relations.</p>

                  <p>Data on the Web tends to be locked into non-interoperable Web systems or be only usable by applications which created it. Actors - creators and readers - in these systems often do not have the means to switch between applications and share data between them.</p>

                  <p>There is a lack of diverse value chains for different units of scholarly communication due to tightly coupled proprietary systems. The actors in these systems create and exchange information by (or forced into) using packaged systems and workflows, give up their rights, and not have control over how their creations can be disseminated and reused.</p>

                  <p>The actors in the system commonly use print-centric tools and data representations to exchange content on the Web and neglect native affordances of the Web (media). Actors' possibility to shape their contributions in Web media is typically constrained to third-party service provider's centralised and non-interoperable solutions. Consequently, resulting in deficiencies and in an inequitable ecosystem.</p>

                  <p>Social aspects of scholarly communication are not well tied together in that actors "rent" personal and professional identifiers and storage from third-parties, manage multiple disconnected profiles, their social connections, and data spaces.</p>

                  <p>These class of problems in the scholarly ecosystem have implications on access, interoperability, findability, cost and privacy, to name a few.</p>

                  <p>In order for systems and actors in scholarly communication to efficiently and effectively participate in exchanging information and knowledge through the Web, they need to have more control over their artefacts, be able to use their preferred data spaces and socially-aware applications, use own Web identities in applications, ability to better shape their digital creations, as well as to enable and facilitate their reuse.</p>

* characterisation of scholarly communication in context of the Web
* devising a decentralised model for scholarly communication
* human and machine-readable representation for units of communication and interactions


 What can scholarly communication achieve when we study and celebrate maximum innovation?

  How can we improve the scholarly communication process on the Web?
  How can we improve scholarly communication by incorporating the inherent qualities (native characteristics?) of the Web?

  How can we improve scholarly communication .. autonomous, .. social

  What is the issue of centralisation for scholars on the Web?
  How is the issue of centralisation for scholars on the Web?

  How can open Web-native standards be applied to realise a contributor-centric scholarly communication?

  How can open (Semantic) Web-native standards contribute to solve information centralisation and interoperability problems in publishing, annotations scholarly communication, lower their access costs, increase their quality, and facilitate their reuse and analysis? If not, what extensions are needed?


                <ul>
                  <li>What are the units of human and machine-readable scholarly information? Why self-publishing and what is it like to actualise? What constitutes a scholarly contribution on the Web? What can be deconstructed? What and at what granularity can information be communicated? What are persistent and permanent artefacts? Where would distributed scholarly information exist, be findable and used?</li>
                  <li>Does scholarly communication on the Web amplify or intensify decentralisation? Or is it the case where scholarly information is easily centralised? How can the workflows in scholarly communication be realised using Web technologies in a decentralised fashion? Do we have the fundamental mechanisms and ability to derive at feasible implementations to adopt a decentralised scholarly Web paradigm?</li>
                  <li>Is there a paradigm shift and what is our situation? What are the effects of social Web on scholars? Are the new forms of involvement revive what was once lost? How can scholars participate and exchange information in a decentralised manner?</li>
                </ul>


  What does improve mean:
  * Technical: Web-native (5 LR principles?); ..
  ** How can we realize a Web-native and decentralised scholarly communication?

  ** How can we represent and author scholarly information on the Web? (structure of scholarly information)
  ** Why self-publishing (contributions) and how can we facilitate it? (decentralisation, social scholarly web)
  ** How can it be more social?
  ** How can we reuse data to improve information quality towards learnability and trust?
  *** integrate data and textual publications? (interactive linked statistics)



  * Social: collaboration and workflows
  ** How can collaboration and workflows in scholarly communication be realised using Web technologies in decentralised manner? (publishing, annotations, call for contributions, proceedings...)

  * Economic:
  ** Cost for publishing and reuse?

  [
  Contrasting approaches;.. removal of some barriers (technological)
  Works technologically but there are other variables at play..
  ]

  * how should we combine open standards to realise this?

  Hypothesis:
  * Compared to standard (established) publication (registration) approach, actor (content creator) having control of registration and accessibility functions improves shaping of information and interpretability
  ** how much improve? what's significant?

  * check qualitative hypothesis.. ?


  How to we ensure that inquiries can locate units of information?


  problem statement:
  * a lot of defficinencies in the current SC... it is however possible SC fulfills all required functinos.. self-publishing paradigm..


  How do people define "open communication"?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_science


Who can be a publisher?
  Why self-publishing?

Question: How do we know who is who in a social network without authentication?
So:
Hypothesis: lack of widely deployed (standardised) decentralised authentication mechanisms impede adoption of the distributed Web paradigm.</div>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Literature Review and Citations</h3>
                <div data="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>The five review characteristics; focus, goal, perspective, coverage, and audience, are borrowed from the summary at <cite><a data-versiondate="2018-10-27T14:59:46Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20181027145946/https://pareonline.net/pdf/v14n13.pdf" href="https://pareonline.net/pdf/v14n13.pdf">Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation</a></cite>, Randolph, 2009, which is based on <cite>Organizing knowledge syntheses: A taxonomy of literature reviews</cite>, Cooper, 1988.</p>

                  <p><strong>Focus</strong>: The core focus of the reviews and cited material was to establish a connection between the available theories, as well as the application of certain interventions to help identify and apply a practical need. Hence, majority of the analysis and synthesis focuses on practices or applications in the field.</p>

                  <p><strong>Goal</strong>: My intention is to present this thesis in a way that is technically and meaningfully connected with the knowledge out there. Hence, I would like any reader (human or machine) in the future to be able to observe and verify the connections that I have put together as much as possible. The main interest for the reviews and citations were information integration for the big picture, identification and discussion of central issues, and explicating arguments.</p>

                  <p><strong>Perspective</strong>: As this thesis is about connecting and endorsing open scholarly knowledge in context of decentralised and social Web, there is a selection bias in favour of (research) information based on the following criteria:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Publicly accessible URL in the case of digital objects.</li>
                    <li>Referencable URI in the case of printed material.</li>
                    <li>Article and data including full text and media.</li>
                    <li>Accessible by anyone (humans and machines).</li>
                    <li>Available to anyone without financial, legal, or technical barriers (besides an Internet connection, free of charge).</li>
                    <li>Preference for source materials (as opposed to third-party re-publications).</li>
                    <li>Preference for research artifacts that can be publicly archived and recalled with free on-demand services.</li>
                    <li>Preference for research artifacts made available with declarative languages (as opposed to dynamically generated as part of an application).</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>At the time of this writing, HTTP URIs of research objects resolving to <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> landing pages were excluded. The rationale is that if information is <em>only</em> available to a subset of humans, then it is not deemed to be part of the observable and reproducible universal knowledge - a fundamental requirement of applying the scientific method. Fortunately, I was able to gather plenty of "open" and "free" resources to support the narrative of this thesis.</p>

                  <p><strong>Coverage</strong>: The reviewed and cited works are composed of a purposive sample, examining only pivotal works and the source of concepts in the field to tie them together. While this selection is naturally not exhaustive in and itself, I have considered, located, and discussed material that was available at the time of my investigation. While there may be natural imperfections in data collection, evaluation, analysis, and interpretation in any literature review and bibliographic citations, I have aimed to be systematic in what's covered. To that end, the works - text, data, media, or other - mentioned in this thesis were included or excluded based on the following criteria:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Information in English.</li>
                    <li>Web accessible digital objects.</li>
                    <li>Printed material available through a public library loan.</li>
                    <li>Referencing information that is legally made available to the public (to the best of my knowledge!)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Organisation</strong>: Historical and conceptual formats were used as organisation schemes. My observations and categorisations are in <a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web">Scholarly Communication on the Web</a>, <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information">Structure of Scholarly Information</a> and <a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication">Decentralising Scholarly Communication</a>, and are first organised conceptually, and then chronologically ordered.</p>

                  <p><strong>Audience</strong>: for anyone interested in traversing the connections and building on the underlying results.</p>

              <p class="todo">What's my motivation? What's my story? There is a problem people care about. I have an approach that gives a piece of the solution. Gather around folks..</p>

              <p id="information-society">I live in an <q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_society">information society</a></q> that uses variety of media technology to communicate and advance societal concerns. The Web has shaped social policies and practices around the world. It has also influenced individuals to be active participants in information exchange, as well as passive consumers given the abundance of instantaneously accessible information. To date (30 years old as of this writing), the Web has been used to do good as well as evil.</p>

              <p id="frameworks">But, from where should we start this? I argue that in order to contextualise the research goals, and even before identifying stakeholders, I argue that understanding communication mediums and scientific revolutions, as well as their effects on society is essential. My intention is to use the available conceptual and technical frameworks to situate the knowledge and the artefacts generated in this thesis. One overarching goal is to foster the social machinery from different perspectives that is required to build a knowledge Web for any type of user; human or machine.</p>

              <p id="assumptions">I assume that researchers in scholarly communication are motivated to some extent personally, whether that is with goal to take part in advancing collective knowledge, society and life, career advancement, prestige, or financial gain. Researchers are intrinsically interested in making their impact by way of sharing their findings in manner that is most accessible to potential users. As for the underlying technical machinery for information exchange, I assume that it is useful to aim in designing interoperable information systems to help us address problems in context of societal goals. All of these aspects are part of the "social machine" of scholarly communication, and are explored through the sections.</p>

              <p id="up-next">As many before me have argued, for scholarly communication to be more effective, we need to take advantage of the native affordances of the Web. This is particularly important if the academic and social activities continues to use the Web as the primary medium to communicate, as opposed to designing and using systems that mimic paper media. Hence, I examine the core characteristics of the Web, and how it can be used to its fullest degree to conduct scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
Current paradigm sucks...

    Why does the research need to be conducted?

    Problem identification (What is wrong with the current situation)
    Background (what is the nature of the problem that readers need to understand)
    Scope of the problem (How big is the problem; # of persons affected)
    Consequences of the problem (what is the cost of not fixing it)
    Knowledge gaps (what info is lacking)
    Proposed solution (how will this new study contribute to solving the problem)

    <pre>scholarly communication didn't change much but ... we don't exploit the technical advances
    * we can't find things.. or at least cumbersome (text-based and/or structured interfaces to find/discover). web of documents -> data
    * coupling of functions (--- maybe not. this is not directly a concern for the researcher but on the evolution of the system)
    * (de)centralisation</pre>

              <p>The field of our study is interdisciplinary given that scholarly communication in conjunction with the Web is an interplay of sociotechnical systems. The work described here captures a particular connection of ideas and development crossing over Web sciences and engineering, media theory and application, autonomous and federation of information systems.</p>

              <p>The context of this thesis is based on the neutrally observable scholarly communication in conjunction with the World Wide Web. Thus, what will be described here will not be about the imminent transformation to what scholarly communication is or how it should be, but rather a description of a network of relatable ideas, initiatives, and development.</p>


              <p>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover relations. The knowledge industry can better address societal challenges by embracing the virtues of the Web via decentralisation and interconnectivity of our collective knowledge.</p>

  <pre>* How do the sociotechnical developments affected scholarly communication on the Web? 3-4 decades. (problems for day to day operations for a researcher/user)
* Problems in scholarly communication (an analysis of core areas)
** open access to scholarly communication
** Proliferation of scientific publications (In the last 10 years, the scientific output in the form of published articles has almost doubled https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18300/nsf18300.pdf)
** Reproducibility
** Inadequate use of electronic / Web-native possibilities (eg due to third-party workflows/publication pipelines)
** Findability and retrievability -- machine-assisted
** (inter)Linking distributed scholarly artefacts

** influence of venue level metrics distracts from assessing individual contributions
** peer-review
** Social aspects are not well tied together - disconnected social graphs, personal/profile data
  </pre>

                  <p>Is and can our system be productive, resilient and organised? Can it evolve? If redesigned, can it operate within established and unexpected parameters as part of a even greater larger ecosystem? What assumptions have we adopted?</p>

* characterisation of scholarly communication in context of the Web
* devising a decentralised model for scholarly communication
* human and machine-readable representation for units of communication and interactions


      <pre>What can scholarly communication achieve when we study and celebrate maximum innovation?

  How can we improve the scholarly communication process on the Web?
  How can we improve scholarly communication by incorporating the inherent qualities (native characteristics?) of the Web?

  How can we improve scholarly communication .. autonomous, .. social

  What is the issue of centralisation for scholars on the Web?
  How is the issue of centralisation for scholars on the Web?

  How can open Web-native standards be applied to realise a contributor-centric scholarly communication?

  How can open (Semantic) Web-native standards contribute to solve information centralisation and interoperability problems in publishing, annotations scholarly communication, lower their access costs, increase their quality, and facilitate their reuse and analysis? If not, what extensions are needed?


                <ul>
                  <li>What are the units of human and machine-readable scholarly information? Why self-publishing and what is it like to actualise? What constitutes a scholarly contribution on the Web? What can be deconstructed? What and at what granularity can information be communicated? What are persistent and permanent artefacts? Where would distributed scholarly information exist, be findable and used?</li>
                  <li>Does scholarly communication on the Web amplify or intensify decentralisation? Or is it the case where scholarly information is easily centralised? How can the workflows in scholarly communication be realised using Web technologies in a decentralised fashion? Do we have the fundamental mechanisms and ability to derive at feasible implementations to adopt a decentralised scholarly Web paradigm?</li>
                  <li>Is there a paradigm shift and what is our situation? What are the effects of social Web on scholars? Are the new forms of involvement revive what was once lost? How can scholars participate and exchange information in a decentralised manner?</li>
                </ul>


  What does improve mean:
  * Technical: Web-native (5 LR principles?); ..
  ** How can we realize a Web-native and decentralised scholarly communication?

  ** How can we represent and author scholarly information on the Web? (structure of scholarly information)
  ** Why self-publishing (contributions) and how can we facilitate it? (decentralisation, social scholarly web)
  ** How can it be more social?
  ** How can we reuse data to improve information quality towards learnability and trust?
  *** integrate data and textual publications? (interactive linked statistics)



  * Social: collaboration and workflows
  ** How can collaboration and workflows in scholarly communication be realised using Web technologies in decentralised manner? (publishing, annotations, call for contributions, proceedings...)

  * Economic:
  ** Cost for publishing and reuse?

  [
  Contrasting approaches;.. removal of some barriers (technological)
  Works technologically but there are other variables at play..
  ]

  * how should we combine open standards to realise this?

  Hypothesis:
  * Compared to standard (established) publication (registration) approach, actor (content creator) having control of registration and accessibility functions improves freedom of expression and interpretability
  ** how much improve? what's significant?

  * check qualitative hypothesis.. ?


  How to we ensure that inquiries can locate units of information?


  problem statement:
  * a lot of defficinencies in the current SC... it is however possible SC fulfills all required functinos.. self-publishing paradigm..


  How do people define "open communication"?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_science


Who can be a publisher?
  Why self-publishing?

Question: How do we know who is who in a social network without authentication?
So:
Hypothesis: lack of widely deployed (standardised) decentralised authentication mechanisms impede adoption of the distributed Web paradigm.

                  <p><strong>Goal</strong>: My intention is to present this thesis in a way that is technically and meaningfully connected with the knowledge out there. Hence, I would like any reader (human or machine) in the future to be able to observe and verify the connections that I have put together as much as possible. The main interest for the reviews and citations were information integration for the big picture, identification and discussion of central issues, and explicating arguments.</p>

                  <p><strong>Perspective</strong>: As this thesis is about connecting and endorsing open scholarly knowledge in context of decentralised and social Web, there is a selection bias in favour of (research) information based on the following criteria:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Publicly accessible URL in the case of digital objects.</li>
                    <li>Referencable URI in the case of printed material.</li>
                    <li>Article and data including full text and media.</li>
                    <li>Accessible by anyone (humans and machines).</li>
                    <li>Available to anyone without financial, legal, or technical barriers (besides an Internet connection, free of charge).</li>
                    <li>Preference for source materials (as opposed to third-party re-publications).</li>
                    <li>Preference for research artifacts that can be publicly archived and recalled with free on-demand services.</li>
                    <li>Preference for research artifacts made available with declarative languages (as opposed to dynamically generated as part of an application).</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>At the time of this writing, HTTP URIs of research objects resolving to <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> landing pages were excluded. The rationale is that if information is <em>only</em> available to a subset of humans, then it is not deemed to be part of the observable and reproducible universal knowledge - a fundamental requirement of applying the scientific method. Fortunately, I was able to gather plenty of "open" and "free" resources to support the narrative of this thesis.</p>

                  <p><strong>Coverage</strong>: The reviewed and cited works are composed of a purposive sample, examining only pivotal works and the source of concepts in the field to tie them together. While this selection is naturally not exhaustive in and itself, I have considered, located, and discussed material that was available at the time of my investigation. While there may be natural imperfections in data collection, evaluation, analysis, and interpretation in any literature review and bibliographic citations, I have aimed to be systematic in what's covered. To that end, the works - text, data, media, or other - mentioned in this thesis were included or excluded based on the following criteria:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Information in English.</li>
                    <li>Web accessible digital objects.</li>
                    <li>Printed material available through a public library loan.</li>
                    <li>Referencing information that is legally made available to the public (to the best of my knowledge!)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Organisation</strong>: Historical and conceptual formats were used as organisation schemes. My observations and categorisations are in <a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web">Scholarly Communication on the Web</a>, <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information">Structure of Scholarly Information</a> and <a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication">Decentralising Scholarly Communication</a>, and are first organised conceptually, and then chronologically ordered.</p>

                  <p><strong>Audience</strong>: for anyone interested in traversing the connections and building on the underlying results.</p>

                  <p>I use the terms "thesis" and "article" interchangeably to refer to the work here. I use the term "section" for significant content grouping. I have refrained from using terms that are closely associated with the print media, so for example, there are no "chapters" in this article, just "sections" or the collection of identifiable and accessible resources.</p>

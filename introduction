              <p>Well, that is what this thesis is going to be all about. It is about the modern scholarly communication, and just because it is there, shapes the way we think and behave, and why it exists in the form it does, and who or what was responsible for it to exist at all. What is an alternative way of change?</p>

              <p>The idiosyncratic relationships between technological breakthroughs and societal transformations throughout history are intrinsically intertwined. It was not until I came across <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connections_%28TV_series%29">Connections</a></cite>, the TV series by James Burke that I had a glimpse of the phenomenon about the increasingly interlinked human endeavours over time. After encountering Marshall McLuhan's theories on communication and how media has the power to shape and transform human nature, what to do next was all clear (in my head). Given these realisations or perspectives as a foundation, being a Web technologist only enabled me to build the necessary connections between what was previously missing or underdeveloped. The rest was mostly a matter of struggling with the ghost in the machine and working alongside our shared social challenges.</p>

              <p>My personal motivation for the underlying research has much to do with an array of experiences in how research communication is carried out in the Semantic Web field, as well as in other academic disciplines. The "too long; didn't read" version is that because it was next to impossible to change the social behaviour of my colleagues, ie. essentially using the paper-centric framework to create and disseminate publicly-funded knowledge by waving their hard-earned "rights" and handing it off to a third-party "publisher" which still operated in the 15th century, all meanwhile the Web is baffled by the distracted academics' practices. Hence, just to prove some Internet strangers wrong, I took the liberty to test the boundaries and demonstrate what the native affordances of the Web - an extension of our central nervous system - enabled and empowered individuals.</p>

              <p id="information-society">I live in an <q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_society">information society</a></q>, which makes use of variety of communication media to meet societal needs. The Web has shaped social policies and practices around the world, as well as influence the creation and use of other technologies. It has also reconfigured individuals to be active participants in global information exchange, as well as passive consumers partly due to the abundance of instantaneously available multimedia. To date - 30 years old as of this writing - the Web has served for "good" and "evil", nevertheless a net positive for the world. Like any human technology, what we devise and how we use them has societal implications.</p>

              <p id="the-story">We can start this story from anywhere. I argue that in order to best contextualise this thesis, it is essential to operate under the understanding of communication mediums and scientific revolutions, as well as their effects on society. This is especially because the research goals of this thesis at its core is <em>sociotechnical</em>, and that a clear division between them will not do its justice. I believe that in order to push the boundaries of our knowledge further, it necessitates a multidisciplinary undertaking - taken <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_of_salt">with a grain of salt</q>. One overarching goal is to foster the social machinery from different perspectives that is required to build a knowledge Web for any type of user; human, machine, or other. While I set the problem context to scholarly communication, applications of the knowledge and generated artefacts are potentially applicable to other initiatives in society.</p>

              <p id="assumptions">I assume that researchers in scholarly communication are motivated to some extent personally, whether that is with the goal to take part in advancing collective knowledge, society and life, career advancement, prestige, or financial gain. Researchers are intrinsically interested in making their impact by way of sharing their findings in a manner that is most accessible to potential users. As for the underlying technical machinery for information exchange, I assume that it is useful to aim in designing interoperable information systems to help us address problems in context of societal goals. All of these aspects are part of the "social machine" of scholarly communication, and are explored through the sections.</p>

              <p id="up-next">As many have argued, for scholarly communication to be more effective; accessible, usable, inclusive, as well as equitable, we need to adopt methods that are better at identifying and making use of the native affordances of the Web. This is particularly important today since academic and social activities use the Web as the primary medium to communicate (in contrast to systems that mimic paper media). Hence, I examine the core characteristics of the Web, discuss the state of affairs in scholarly communication, and share my findings on how a way to fulfill the forces and functions in scientific communication can be met by a socially-aware decentralised client application.</p>

              <p>This section contains the <em>outlines</em> for social and technical research goals of this thesis. Each goal is further explored and related material is reviewed in relevant sections.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>In research projects, there are various stakeholders (in)directly acting as internal and external forces in scholarly communication. In order to address societal concerns, research sponsors fund projects to attain reusable technical designs and acquire new knowledge in the process. Knowledge workers like researchers and scholars are driven by curiosity to advance our understanding of the universe and share their findings. The public is interested in accessing applications of research to educate and for the well-being of life. The industry needs efficient functioning of scientific communication in order to translate the return of research capital.</p>

                  <p>In the underlying work, I am a stakeholder acting as a knowledge worker, a member of the public, an operator (<q>end user</q>, maintainer, operational supporter).</p>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Problem Context</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>There are several sociotechnical limitations in the contemporary paradigm that the scholarly communication operates in. I will summarise a subset of problem areas pertaining to interoperability of systems and autonomy of actors. Each problem space will be reviewed in relevant sections of this thesis.</p>

                  <p>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover, make sense of, and create new connections between information.</p>

                  <p>Data on the Web tends to be locked into non-interoperable Web systems or be only usable by applications which created it. Actors - creators and readers - in these systems often do not have the means to switch between applications and share data between them.</p>

                  <p>There is a lack of diverse value chains for different units of scholarly communication due to tightly coupled proprietary systems. The actors in these systems create and exchange information by (being forced into) using packaged systems and workflows, give up their rights, and not have control over how their creations can be disseminated and reused.</p>

                  <p>The actors in the system commonly use print-centric tools and data representations to exchange content on the Web and neglect to take advantage of the available affordances of the Web (media). Actors' possibility to shape their contributions in Web media is typically constrained to third-party service provider's centralised and non-interoperable solutions.</p>

                  <p>Actors' rental of personal and professional identifiers, as well as data storage from third-parties are subject to privacy issues. Actors typically manage multiple disconnected profiles, social connections, and data spaces.</p>

                  <p>These class of problems in the scholarly ecosystem have implications on access, interoperability, findability, cost and privacy. Consequently, resulting in global deficiencies in the ecosystem. The research questions; <cite><a href="#technical-research-problems">technical research problems</a></cite> and <cite><a href="#knowled-questions">knowledge questions</a></cite>, are aimed at understanding the internal mechanisms of these type of problems and address them for stakeholders.</p>

                  <p>The technical goals of this thesis are, given the <a href="#problem-context">problem context</a>, to identify gaps in the Web standards landscape and to create new technical standards where necessary.

                  <p>The knowledge goals of this thesis describe the theoretical underpinnings necessary to accomplish the <a href="#technical-research-goals">technical research goals</a>.</p>

                  <p>We need to understand the various technological mediums in which scholarly communication has historically operated, and how and why this has changed, in order to have a frame of reference for new work. Our investigation must examine scholarship with respect to the media employed for publication, dissemination and feedback, and identify some of the constraints and limitations. This research can serve to describe the effects and artefacts of scholarly communication, as well as conceptual and technical designs that are used to exchange units of information by both humans and machines.</p>

                  <p>The scholarly communication ecosystem is a complex sociotechnical system, which cannot be understood from either a social or a technical perspective alone. Understanding how these aspects feed into and influence on another is crucial for the furtherance of this work.</p>

                  <p>The corpus of knowledge collected in this thesis is driven by understanding the current state of knowledge in the field based on scientific, technical, and professional literature. <cite><a href="#literature-review-and-citations">Literature Review and Citations</a></cite> describes the constraints on how research knowledge will be collected.</p>

                  <p>The five review characteristics; focus, goal, perspective, coverage, and audience, are borrowed from the summary at <cite><a data-versiondate="2018-10-27T14:59:46Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20181027145946/https://pareonline.net/pdf/v14n13.pdf" href="https://pareonline.net/pdf/v14n13.pdf">Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation</a></cite>, Randolph, 2009, which is based on <cite>Organizing knowledge syntheses: A taxonomy of literature reviews</cite>, Cooper, 1988.</p>

                  <p><strong>Focus</strong>: The core focus of the reviews and cited material was to establish a connection between the available theories and their underlying mechanisms, as well as the application of certain interventions to help identify and apply a practical need. Hence, majority of the analysis and synthesis focuses on practices or applications in the field.</p>

                  <p><strong>Goal</strong>: My intention is to present this thesis in a way that is technically and meaningfully connected with the knowledge out there, as well as to connect my contributions. Hence, I would like any reader (human or machine) in the future to be able to observe and verify the connections that I have put together as much as possible. The main interest for the reviews and citations were information integration for the big picture, identification and discussion of central issues, and explicating arguments.</p>

                  <p><strong>Perspective</strong>: As this thesis is about connecting and endorsing open scholarly knowledge in context of decentralised and social Web, there is a selection bias in favour of (research) information based on the following criteria:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Publicly accessible URL in the case of digital objects.</li>
                    <li>Referencable URI in the case of printed material.</li>
                    <li>Article and data including full text and media.</li>
                    <li>Accessible by anyone (humans and machines).</li>
                    <li>Available to anyone without financial, legal, or technical barriers (besides an Internet connection, free of charge).</li>
                    <li>Preference for source materials (as opposed to third-party re-publications).</li>
                    <li>Preference for research artifacts that can be publicly archived and recalled with free on-demand services.</li>
                    <li>Preference for research artifacts made available with declarative languages (as opposed to dynamically generated as part of an application).</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>At the time of this writing, HTTP URIs of research objects resolving to <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> landing pages were excluded. The rationale is that if information is <em>only</em> available to a subset of humans, then it is not deemed to be part of the observable and reproducible universal knowledge - a fundamental requirement of applying the scientific method. Fortunately, I was able to gather plenty of "open" and "free" resources to support the narrative of this thesis, and addressing its knowledge goals.</p>

                  <p><strong>Coverage</strong>: The reviewed and cited works are composed of a purposive sample, examining only pivotal works and the source of concepts in the field to tie them together. While this selection is naturally not exhaustive in and itself, I have considered, located, and discussed material that was available at the time of my investigation. While there may be natural imperfections in data collection, evaluation, analysis, and interpretation in any literature review and bibliographic citations, I have aimed to be systematic in what's covered. To that end, the works - text, data, media, or other - mentioned in this thesis were included or excluded based on the following criteria:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Information in English.</li>
                    <li>Web accessible digital objects.</li>
                    <li>Printed material available through a public library loan.</li>
                    <li>Referencing information that is legally made available to the public (to the best of my knowledge!)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Organisation</strong>: Historical and conceptual formats were used as organisation schemes. My observations and categorisations are in <a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web">Scholarly Communication on the Web</a>, <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information">Structure of Scholarly Information</a> and <a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication">Decentralising Scholarly Communication</a>, and are first organised conceptually, and then chronologically ordered.</p>

                  <p><strong>Audience</strong>: for anyone interested in traversing the connections and building on the underlying findings. See also <cite><a href="#audience">audience</a></cite>.</p>

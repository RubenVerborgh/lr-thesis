            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>The field of our study is interdisciplinary given that scholarly communication in conjunction with the Web is an interplay of socio-technical systems. The work described here captures a particular connection of ideas and development crossing over Web sciences and engineering, media theory and application, autonomous and federation of information systems.</p>

              <p>The context of this thesis is based on the neutrally observable scholarly communication in conjunction with the World Wide Web. Thus, what will be described here will not be about the imminent transformation to what scholarly communication is or how it should be, but rather a description of a network of relatable ideas, initiatives, and development.</p>


              <p>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover relations. The knowledge industry can better address societal challenges by embracing the virtues of the Web via decentralisation and interconnectivity of our collective knowledge.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>Why bother? Society needs to continuously sharpen its understanding of the biases as well as the effects of the sociotechnical processes involved in scholarly communication, in order to control its impact and guide it.</p>

          <p>Is and can our system be productive, resilient and organised? Can it evolve? If redesigned, can it operate within established and unexpected parameters as part of a even greater larger ecosystem? What assumptions have we adopted?</p>

<p>.. "#OpenScience" that has a wider scope than what revolves around those "publishers" ie. acknowledging the possibility that scholarly information can come from and be anywhere provided that it is "scientific". Then we can accurately analyse "openness".</p>

                    <li>How can we go beyond the barriers? .. Data structures/models... Web standards/stack</li>
                    <li>Operative level: workflows?, processes?.. improving suitable communication interfaces</li>
                    <li>How well can people in the scientific community (progressive/conservation/or even backwards) get their job done.. How usable is it?</li>

                    <li>How can we lift the concepts of articles for scholarly communication</li>
                    <li>How can the workflows in scholarly communication be realised using Web technologies in decentralised manner</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>A possible hypothesis is that a lack of an appropriate authentication mechanism impedes adoption of decentralised Web paradigm.</li>

          <p>This thesis serves a multi-purpose role. The typical role is by employing different reading modes, the reader can consume its contents through their preferred medium eg, printed paper, electronic device access to the Web. The other, and less common, is an exemplification of the Linked Research design principles, and the technical implementation itself. For instance, when this thesis is access through the Web, it demonstrates itself, since the interactive and semantic features can be directly observed while reading and consuming. It showcases how scholarly communication can adapt to the audience, whether the content is read on a screen or printed on paper, listen with a screen reader, watched as a movie, shown as a presentation, interacted with in the document, as well as its social functions.</p>

    <p>As per <cite><a href="https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/263347">A Framework for Web Science</a></cite>, Linked Research can be seen as one way to further the science of decentralised information systems in context of scholarly communication, as well as the the study of <em>Web Science</em> itself.</p>

    <p>As we embrace the Web as the medium for LR, we consider that interconnectivity of scholarly work can be improved foremost through the Linked Data stack. The initiative to use the [Semantic] Web to its full potential for scholarly activities is nothing new. The LR approach is however timely in the sense that a substantial number of fundamental Web standards have matured to interact with the paradigm shift in scholarly communication, but we find that to meet some of these principles we have to still develop new standards and tools.</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Context</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>The field of our study is interdisciplinary given that scholarly communication in conjunction with the Web is an interplay of socio-technical systems. The work described here captures a particular connection of ideas and development crossing over Web sciences and engineering, media theory and application, autonomous and federation of information systems.</p>

              <p>The context of this thesis is based on the neutrally observable scholarly communication in conjunction with the World Wide Web. Thus, what will be described here will not be about the imminent transformation to what scholarly communication is or how it should be, but rather a description of a network of relatable ideas, initiatives, and development.</p>


              <p>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover relations. The knowledge industry can better address societal challenges by embracing the virtues of the Web via decentralisation and interconnectivity of our collective knowledge.</p>

<pre>
* How do the sociotechnical developments affected scholarly communication on the Web? 3-4 decades. (problems for day to day operations for a researcher/user)
* Problems in scholarly communication (an analysis of core areas)
** open access to scholarly communication
** Proliferation of scientific publications (In the last 10 years, the scientific output in the form of published articles has almost doubled https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18300/nsf18300.pdf)
** Reproducibility
** Inadequate use of electronic / Web-native possibilities (eg due to third-party workflows/publication pipelines)
** Findability and retrievability -- machine-assisted
** (inter)Linking distributed scholarly artefacts

** influence of venue level metrics distracts from assessing individual contributions
** peer-review
** Social aspects are not well tied together - disconnected social graphs, personal/profile data

            <h2 property="schema:name">Need</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>Why bother? Society needs to continuously sharpen its understanding of the biases as well as the effects of the sociotechnical processes involved in scholarly communication, in order to control its impact and guide it.</p>
            </div>
          </section>

<hr/>

          <p>Is and can our system be productive, resilient and organised? Can it evolve? If redesigned, can it operate within established and unexpected parameters as part of a even greater larger ecosystem? What assumptions have we adopted?</p>

          <p>.. "#OpenScience" that has a wider scope than what revolves around those "publishers" ie. acknowledging the possibility that scholarly information can come from and be anywhere provided that it is "scientific". Then we can accurately analyse "openness".</p>

          <p>This thesis serves a multi-purpose role. The typical role is by employing different reading modes, the reader can consume its contents through their preferred medium eg, printed paper, electronic device access to the Web. The other, and less common, is an exemplification of the Linked Research design principles, and the technical implementation itself. For instance, when this thesis is access through the Web, it demonstrates itself, since the interactive and semantic features can be directly observed while reading and consuming. It showcases how scholarly communication can adapt to the audience, whether the content is read on a screen or printed on paper, listen with a screen reader, watched as a movie, shown as a presentation, interacted with in the document, as well as its social functions.</p>

  <h2 property="schema:name">Problem Statement</h2>
  <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
<pre>
scholarly communication didn't change much but ... we don't exploit the technical advances
* we can't find things.. or at least cumbersome (text-based and/or structured interfaces to find/discover). web of documents -> data
* coupling of functions (--- maybe not. this is not directly a concern for the researcher but on the evolution of the system)
* (de)centralisation

<section id="research-questions" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#research-questions">
  <h2 property="schema:name">Research Questions</h2>
  <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
<pre>
How can we realize a Web-native and decentralised scholarly communication?

* How can we represent and author scholarly information on the Web? (structure of scholarly information)

* Why self-publishing (contributions) and how can we facilitate it? (decentralisation, social scholarly web)

* How can collaboration and workflows in scholarly communication be realised using Web technologies in decentralised manner? (publishing, annotations, call for contributions, proceedings...)

* How can we integrate data and textual publications? (interactive linked statistics)

Out of scope: non Web-native protocols/standards eg blockchain, transformation/extraction workflows, search/find, ontology/vocabulary for units of information, profile creation/editing, storage/server mechanisms, filtering articles

<section id="assumptions" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#assumptions">
  <h2 property="schema:name">Assumptions</h2>
  <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
    <p>At many times in this thesis it may appear that I am taking an idealist stance with regards to the motivations of academics, but certainly many (even most) academic researchers are motivated to some extent by personal gain, whether that is career advancement, prestige, influence, or financial gain. All of these aspects are part of the "social machine" of scholarly communication, and are explored in [the various appropriate chapters].</p>

    <p>As for the technical machinery, the assumption is that researchers want to share their articles and artefacts in good faith, with other researchers and the public at large. Nevertheless, we're always aware that at all times there are other social factors at play which may need to be addressed in combination with the technical solutions.</p>

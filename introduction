          <p id="information-society">The term <q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_society">information society</a></q> is used to loosely denote increasingly central role of information and communication technologies in social and economic activity. With the advent of the Internet and the Web, the production, distribution, and consumption of instantaneously accessible networked knowledge has further shaped social policies and practices around the world.</p>

          <p>The core message of this thesis is that, we can apply the lessons from the history of human communication shifts towards answering research questions and the challenges in advancing scholarly communication on the Web. The explanations and the developments propose a way in which the society; and scholars in particular, can be autonomous actors when exchanging their discoveries, knowledge, and innovation. The contributions use the Web architecture and its affordances towards the progress of scholarly communication on the Web that is autonomous, accessible, interpretable, and social.</p>

          <p>This article is about the advancement of intellectual communication using the Web environment. The underlying work is presented with the backdrop of history of information exchange in context of available communication mediums. We will soon discuss the past human endeavours towards enlightenment in order to orient ourselves with the current affairs in scholarly communication. We will then seek the fundamental differences in intellectual communities in the pursuit of knowledge. Understanding the structures and frameworks of these (meta)physical societies enables us to rationalise their qualities, as well as quantify their constraints and limitations. As we analyse the current state of scholarly communication as part of a global sociotechnical system, our research questions and answers address the challenges and opportunities offered by new media and technologies, alongside efficient (re)use of digital resources for different types of agents. The results are an exemplar for scholarly information exchange on the Web based on the application of open standards and architectural design principles.</p>

          <hr />

          <p>In <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/611804138">The Printing Press as an Agent of Change</a></cite>, 1979, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Eisenstein">Elizabeth Eisenstein</a> traces the impact of the communications revolution on a variety of sociocultural movements that shaped the modern mind that started by the invention of the printing press developed by Johannes Gutenberg (circa 1439). Eisenstein demonstrates that the printing press, as a technological innovation, was a potent force in the evolution of social systems, as well as a communication technology which intensified the evolutionary process in the storage and dissemination of information and data. Perhaps more generally, Eisenstein explains how <q>printing altered <em>written communications within the Commonwealth of Learning</em></q>, p. xiv.</p>

          <p>With the growing power of the printing press since the 15th century, and sufficiently large international readers across Europe, the mass production and distribution of printed material gave rise to the formation of intellectuals as a distinct and independent social class. The long-distance, international, and private correspondence network between the literary figures formed the basis for the concepts, <cite>Commonwealth of Learning</cite>; vernacular science-writing in Latin aimed at non-academic readers, as well as aiding the literary <q>underground</q> trade among researchers to propel theories and data collection, and the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Letters">Republic of Letters</a></cite> (<abbr title="Republic of Letters">RoL</abbr>) - used interchangeably with <q>men of letters</q> and <q>literati</q>, derived from the French term <q lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">homme de lettres</q> - refers to a metaphysical <em>literary</em> society that produced and had access to substantial (non)scientific knowledge in Europe and America in the 17th century, p. 136-139.</p>

          <p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society">The Royal Society</a></cite> (<abbr title="The Royal Society">RS</abbr>) effectively established authority for a metaphysical community for scientists and scholars. In essence, it acknowledge and legitimised the social activity in RoL, and acted as a way to filter and help disseminate the discoveries of the literati. <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_des_s%C3%A7avans">Journal des sçavans</a></cite> published in 1665 was the first academic journal in Europe, followed by <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</a></cite> in the same year. The first journal that strongly focused on scientific communication came later with the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptes_rendus_de_l%27Acad%C3%A9mie_des_Sciences">Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences</a></cite> in 1666.</p>

          <p>We note here that due to societal circumstances, eg. sponsorship and censorship by 'authorities', the literary underground with the help of the printing press was well underway in the 16th century. By 1640 <q>science had risen</q> mostly in the underground, and well pre-dated the discovery and improvement of the telescope p. 685; the RoL; and the establishment of the RS. With the help of the RS later on, new discoveries and theories were disseminated abroad, p. 664.</p>

          <p>Eisenstein postulates that the printed book played a central role in the <q>rapid dissemination of knowledge to whole new classes that created the modern new attitudes to both science and religion at the end of the fifteenth century.</q> The mere availability of prior knowledge to the public, stimulated scientific curiosity further, and eventually gave birth to the scientific revolution, p. 691. Eisenstein also contends that the communication shift in technical literature occurred even before astronomers changed their views about the structure of the universe, p. 685. Moreover, the origins of the scientific revolution was partly due to the rediscovery of classical scientific texts, and the effects of an internal strife between academic innovators and conservationists (<q>quarrels of learned men</q>), trying to control the field of knowledge outside of academia, p. 523-524, 570. Eisenstein emphasises on the <q>relevance of external social institutions to the internal, relatively autonomous, life of science</q>, p. 636, as well as the utilitarian <q>application of the mathematics to the problems of the natural world</q>, p. 683.</p>

          <p>In <a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web">scholarly communication on the Web</a>, we observe the effects of the printing press from the point of McLuhan's theory on the effects of media on the masses and Kuhn's scientific paradigm shifts. The essence of this thesis is to resolve the opposition between the print-centric and the electric (Web) medium in particular to scholarly communication. That is, in order for the current state of scholarly communication to be more effective, we need to apply and use the native affordances of the Web to its fullest degree.</p>

          <hr />

                  <p>This thesis falls into the domain of Web Science as scholarly communication is inherently social and has broad implications across society. In particular, the thesis examines autonomous and interoperable information systems in context of conducting scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

<!--
    <p>As we embrace the Web as the medium for LR, we consider that interconnectivity of scholarly work can be improved foremost through the Linked Data stack. The initiative to use the [Semantic] Web to its full potential for scholarly activities is nothing new. The LR approach is however timely in the sense that a substantial number of fundamental Web standards have matured to interact with the paradigm shift in scholarly communication, but we find that to meet some of these principles we have to still develop new standards and tools.</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Context</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>The field of our study is interdisciplinary given that scholarly communication in conjunction with the Web is an interplay of sociotechnical systems. The work described here captures a particular connection of ideas and development crossing over Web sciences and engineering, media theory and application, autonomous and federation of information systems.</p>

              <p>The context of this thesis is based on the neutrally observable scholarly communication in conjunction with the World Wide Web. Thus, what will be described here will not be about the imminent transformation to what scholarly communication is or how it should be, but rather a description of a network of relatable ideas, initiatives, and development.</p>


              <p>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover relations. The knowledge industry can better address societal challenges by embracing the virtues of the Web via decentralisation and interconnectivity of our collective knowledge.</p>

  <pre>* How do the sociotechnical developments affected scholarly communication on the Web? 3-4 decades. (problems for day to day operations for a researcher/user)
* Problems in scholarly communication (an analysis of core areas)
** open access to scholarly communication
** Proliferation of scientific publications (In the last 10 years, the scientific output in the form of published articles has almost doubled https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18300/nsf18300.pdf)
** Reproducibility
** Inadequate use of electronic / Web-native possibilities (eg due to third-party workflows/publication pipelines)
** Findability and retrievability -- machine-assisted
** (inter)Linking distributed scholarly artefacts

** influence of venue level metrics distracts from assessing individual contributions
** peer-review
** Social aspects are not well tied together - disconnected social graphs, personal/profile data

          <p>Is and can our system be productive, resilient and organised? Can it evolve? If redesigned, can it operate within established and unexpected parameters as part of a even greater larger ecosystem? What assumptions have we adopted?</p>

          <p>.. "#OpenScience" that has a wider scope than what revolves around those "publishers" ie. acknowledging the possibility that scholarly information can come from and be anywhere provided that it is "scientific". Then we can accurately analyse "openness".</p>

          <p>This thesis serves a multi-purpose role. The typical role is by employing different reading modes, the reader can consume its contents through their preferred medium eg, printed paper, electronic device access to the Web. The other, and less common, is an exemplification of the Linked Research design principles, and the technical implementation itself. For instance, when this thesis is access through the Web, it demonstrates itself, since the interactive and semantic features can be directly observed while reading and consuming. It showcases how scholarly communication can adapt to the audience, whether the content is read on a screen or printed on paper, listen with a screen reader, watched as a movie, shown as a presentation, interacted with in the document, as well as its social functions.</p>

      <pre>What can scholarly communication achieve when we study and celebrate maximum innovation?

  How can we improve the scholarly communication process on the Web?
  How can we improve scholarly communication by incorporating the inherent qualities (native characteristics?) of the Web?

  How can we improve scholarly communication .. autonomous, .. social

  What is the issue of centralisation for scholars on the Web?
  How is the issue of centralisation for scholars on the Web?

  How can open Web-native standards be applied to realise a contributor-centric scholarly communication?

  How can open (Semantic) Web-native standards contribute to solve information centralisation and interoperability problems in publishing, annotations scholarly communication, lower their access costs, increase their quality, and facilitate their reuse and analysis? If not, what extensions are needed?


                <ul>
                  <li>What are the units of human and machine-readable scholarly information? Why self-publishing and what is it like to actualise? What constitutes a scholarly contribution on the Web? What can be deconstructed? What and at what granularity can information be communicated? What are persistent and permanent artefacts? Where would distributed scholarly information exist, be findable and used?</li>
                  <li>Does scholarly communication on the Web amplify or intensify decentralisation? Or is it the case where scholarly information is easily centralised? How can the workflows in scholarly communication be realised using Web technologies in a decentralised fashion? Do we have the fundamental mechanisms and ability to derive at feasible implementations to adopt a decentralised scholarly Web paradigm?</li>
                  <li>Is there a paradigm shift and what is our situation? What are the effects of social Web on scholars? Are the new forms of involvement revive what was once lost? How can scholars participate and exchange information in a decentralised manner?</li>
                </ul>


  What does improve mean:
  * Technical: Web-native (5 LR principles?); ..
  ** How can we realize a Web-native and decentralised scholarly communication?

  ** How can we represent and author scholarly information on the Web? (structure of scholarly information)
  ** Why self-publishing (contributions) and how can we facilitate it? (decentralisation, social scholarly web)
  ** How can it be more social?
  ** How can we reuse data to improve information quality towards learnability and trust?
  *** integrate data and textual publications? (interactive linked statistics)



  * Social: collaboration and workflows
  ** How can collaboration and workflows in scholarly communication be realised using Web technologies in decentralised manner? (publishing, annotations, call for contributions, proceedings...)

  * Economic:
  ** Cost for publishing and reuse?

  [
  Contrasting approaches;.. removal of some barriers (technological)
  Works technologically but there are other variables at play..
  ]

  * how should we combine open standards to realise this?

  Hypothesis:
  * Compared to standard (established) publication (registration) approach, actor (content creator) having control of registration and accessibility functions improves freedom of expression and interpretability
  ** how much improve? what's significant?

  * check qualitative hypothesis.. ?


  How to we ensure that inquiries can locate units of information?


  problem statement:
  * a lot of defficinencies in the current SC... it is however possible SC fulfills all required functinos.. self-publishing paradigm..


  How do people define "open communication"?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_science


Who can be a publisher?
  Why self-publishing?

Question: How do we know who is who in a social network without authentication?
So:
Hypothesis: lack of widely deployed (standardised) decentralised authentication mechanisms impede adoption of the distributed Web paradigm.

      <p>At many times in this thesis it may appear that I am taking an idealist stance with regards to the motivations of academics, but certainly many (perhaps even most) academic researchers are motivated to some extent by personal gain, whether that is career advancement, prestige, input or influence to society, or financial gain. All of these aspects are part of the "social machine" of scholarly communication, and are explored in [the various appropriate chapters].</p>

      <p>As for the technical machinery, an assumption is that researchers want to share their articles and artefacts in good faith, with other researchers and the public at large. Nevertheless, we're always aware that at all times there are other social factors at play which may need to be addressed in combination with the technical solutions.</p>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Literature Review and Citations</h3>
                <div data="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>The five review characteristics; focus, goal, perspective, coverage, and audience, are borrowed from the summary at <cite><a data-versiondate="2018-10-27T14:59:46Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20181027145946/https://pareonline.net/pdf/v14n13.pdf" href="https://pareonline.net/pdf/v14n13.pdf">Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation</a></cite>, Randolph, 2009, which is based on <cite>Organizing knowledge syntheses: A taxonomy of literature reviews</cite>, Cooper, 1988.</p>

                  <p><strong>Focus</strong>: The core focus of the reviews and cited material was to establish a connection between the available theories, as well as the application of certain interventions to help identify and apply a practical need. Hence, majority of the analysis and synthesis focuses on practices or applications in the field.</p>

                  <p><strong>Goal</strong>: My intention is to present this thesis in a way that is technically and meaningfully connected with the knowledge out there. Hence, I would like any reader (human or machine) in the future to be able to observe and verify the connections that I have put together as much as possible. The main interest for the reviews and citations were information integration for the big picture, identification and discussion of central issues, and explicating arguments.</p>

                  <p><strong>Perspective</strong>: As this thesis is about connecting and endorsing open scholarly knowledge in context of decentralised and social Web, there is a selection bias in favour of (research) information based on the following criteria:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Publicly accessible URL in the case of digital objects.</li>
                    <li>Referencable URI in the case of printed material.</li>
                    <li>Article and data including full text and media.</li>
                    <li>Accessible by anyone (humans and machines).</li>
                    <li>Available to anyone without financial, legal, or technical barriers (besides an Internet connection, free of charge).</li>
                    <li>Preference for source materials (as opposed to third-party re-publications).</li>
                    <li>Preference for research artifacts that can be publicly archived and recalled with free on-demand services.</li>
                    <li>Preference for research artifacts made available with declarative languages (as opposed to dynamically generated as part of an application).</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>At the time of this writing, HTTP URIs of research objects resolving to <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> landing pages were excluded. The rationale is that, if information is <em>only</em> available to a subset of humans, then it is not deemed to be part of the observable and reproducible universal knowledge - a fundamental requirement of applying the scientific method. Fortunately, I was able to gather plenty of "open" and "free" resources to support the narrative of this thesis.</p>

                  <p><strong>Coverage</strong>: The reviewed and cited works are composed of a purposive sample, examining only pivotal works and the source of concepts in the field to tie them together. While this selection is naturally not exhaustive in and itself, I have considered, located, and discussed material that was available at the time of my investigation. While there may be natural imperfections in data collection, evaluation, analysis, and interpretation in any literature review and bibliographic citations, I have aimed to be systematic in what's covered. To that end, the works - text, data, media, or other - mentioned in this thesis were included or excluded based on the following criteria:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Information in English.</li>
                    <li>Web accessible digital objects.</li>
                    <li>Printed material available through a public library loan.</li>
                    <li>Referencing information that is legally made available to the public (to the best of my knowledge!)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><strong>Organisation</strong>: Historical and conceptual formats were used as organisation schemes. The primary background and related work in chapters and sections within <a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web">scholarly-communication-on-the-web</a>, <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information">structure-of-scholarly-information</a>, and <a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication">decentralising-scholarly-communication</a>, are first organised conceptually, and then chronologically ordered.</p>

                  <p><strong>Audience</strong>: for anyone interested in traversing the connections and building on the underlying results.</p>

                  <p>I use the terms "thesis" and "article" interchangeably to refer to the work here. I use the term "section" for significant content grouping. I have refrained from using terms that are closely associated with the paper medium, so for example, there are no "chapters" in this article, just "sections".</p>

                  <p>I deliberately avoid convention with "e.g." and "i.e." abbreviations because I think "eg." and "ie." requires less cognitive effort, and less pretentious.</p>

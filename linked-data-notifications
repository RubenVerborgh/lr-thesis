          <p>As when scholarly and social content is created and registered, it needs to be findable and reusable. The awareness function in scholarly and scientific communication can be addressed with a group of Web-centric standards. For instance, the specifications pertaining to <a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#read-write-linked-data">read-write Linked Data</a>, vocabularies about <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#publishing-and-referencing">publishing resources</a> and <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#participation">social participation</a> can be used to meet a wide array of scholarly and social activities on the decentralised Web.</p>

          <p class="todo">Express as proposed solution for a research question:</p>
          <p>In the section that follows, we will discuss a communications protocol that specifies how actors and applications can use a decentralised Linked Data notifications mechanism in order to fulfil the awareness function.</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Linked Data Notifications</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, including social applications: <q>You have been invited to a graduation party!</q>, <q>Tim commented on your blog post!</q>, <q>Liz tagged you in a photo</q>. The notification data may be displayed to a human to acknowledge, or used to trigger some other application-specific process (or both). <span id="issue" about="#design-issue" datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description" rel="dio:generatedByIntent" resource="#design-intent" typeof="dio:DesignIssue">In a decentralised architecture, notifications can be a key element for federation of information, and application integration. However in <span rel="dio:hasStatus" resource="#design-issue-status" typeof="dio:Active">centralised systems which prevail today</span>, this data is structured arbitrarily and typically only usable by the application that generated it in the first place. Current efforts towards <em>re-decentralising</em> the Web [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a class="ref" href="#ref-2">2</a>, <a class="ref" href="#ref-3">3</a>] are moving towards architectures in which data storage is decoupled from application logic, freeing end users to switch between applications, or to let multiple applications operate over the same data. So far, notifications are considered to be <em>ephemeral</em> resources which may disappear after transport, and thus are excluded from being designed for reuse.</span></p>

              <p id="design-intent" about="#design-intent" datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description" rel="dio:generatesIssue" resource="#design-issue" typeof="dio:Intent">We argue that notification data should not be locked into particular systems. We designed the <em>Linked Data Notifications (LDN)</em> protocol to support sharing and reuse of notifications <em>across</em> applications, regardless of how they were generated or what their contents are. We describe how the principles of identification, addressability and semantic representation can be applied to notifications on the Web. Specifying LDN as a formal protocol allows independently implemented, heterogeneous applications which generate and use notifications, to seamlessly work together. Thus, LDN supports the decentralisation of the Web as well as encourages the generation and consumption of Linked Data.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>By using different arrangements of LDN, WA, AP, LDP mechanisms and related vocabularies, scholarly and social activities can be systematically discovered for a variety of use cases. Decentralised notifications and annotations surrounding an article can be determined as follows:</p>

              <ul>
                <li id="subject-annotation-service">Resource asserts the location of a preferred service for maintaining annotations about the the subject resource (via <code>oa:annotationService</code>) </li>
                <li id="subject-inbox">Resource asserts the location of a service that receives and serves notifications about the subject resource (via <code>ldp:inbox</code>)</li>
                <li id="profile-storage">An individual's profile asserting their preferred storage location (via <code>pim:storage</code>)</li>
                <li id="profile-outbox">An individual's profile asserting the location of their activities (via <code>as:outbox</code>)</li>
                <li id="profile-knows-profile-storage">Members of an individual's social graph (via eg. <code>foaf:knows</code>) asserting their preferred storage location</li>
                <li id="profile-knows-profile-outbox">Members of an individual's social graph asserting the location of their activities</li>
                <li id="inbox-annotation-known">Inbox or annotation service locations are known prior to interaction eg. trusted or used by a community.</li>
                <li id="inbox-annotation-manual">Inbox or annotation service locations are manually input to the system eg. not publicised or private.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Applications can incrementally implement a combination of these approaches to discover distributed activities on the Web. Figure X depicts an interplay of decentralised personal profiles, notifications, and annotations.</p>

              <p class="todo">The relevance of this section/work is about independent publishing (different jurisdictions) but following same line of Web standards / interop... pay-as-you-go... the sum is greater</p>

              <p>This article describes the semantic structure and linking of the W3C Recommendation <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> (LDN), its test suite, and implementation reports.</p>

              <p>Semantically interlinking and detailed machine-readability of components related to Web standards and their implementations is novel, and can be useful for coherently documenting software projects and their conformance with specifications. Everything presented here is open source and reusable by other specifications (W3C standards or not), test suites, and implementations.</p>

              <p>As a concrete example of the benefits of this approach, the LDN test suite is itself an LDN implementation for the purpose of automating the collection and aggregation of implementation reports which were used directly towards the formal standardisation process.</p>

              <p>Notifications are sent over the Web for a variety of purposes, for example, by social applications. The information contained within a notification is structured arbitrarily, and typically only usable by the application which generated it in the first place. In the spirit of Linked Data, we propose that notifications should be reusable by multiple authorised applications. Through separating the concepts of <em>senders</em>, <em>receivers</em> and <em>consumers</em> of notifications, and leveraging Linked Data principles of shared vocabularies and URIs, LDN provides a building block for decentralised Web applications. This permits end users more freedom to switch between the online tools they use, as well as generating greater value when notifications from different sources can be used in combination.</p>

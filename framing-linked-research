              <p>The current and widely accepted paradigm is that scientific contributions are peer-reviewed and made available through credible publishers.</p>

              <p>Talk about brief history of SC from 1600s to today.. one paragraph</p>

              <p>Paradigm shift started in the 90s and continues.. held back by tradition.. social desire for change... plus social web with regards to what's normal communication.</p>

              <p>There has been a increasing trend in transitioning from print to electronic over the course of past decades in how scholars communicate.</p>

              <p>. we borrow the conceptual framework on how <em>paradigms</em>. In the <cite>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</cite>, Kuhn describes...</p>

              <p>happen, we focus on the effects of the Web medium which caused the way scientists conduct their everyday activities. The <em>effect</em> preceding <em>cause</em> seems counter-intuitive to most of us, however, it becomes apparent as McLuhan describes. That is, how did the medium influence our scientific environment, and how we are suddenly in the middle of it?</p>

              <p>With respect to the focus of this thesis, scholarly communication on the Web is confronted with the <em>crisis</em> on 1) the inadequacy of the traditional mode of scientific information exchange, and 2) access to and reuse of information.</p>


              <p>rear-view mirror.. and paradigms</p>
              <p>By confronting the Web using the same methods as with print, the scientific market seeks security and comfort. </p>

              <ul>
                <li>What are the units of human and machine-readable scholarly information? Why self-publishing and what is it like to actualise? What constitutes a scholarly contribution on the Web? What can be deconstructed? What and at what granularity can information be communicated? What are persistent and permanent artefacts? Where would distributed scholarly information exist, be findable and used?</li>
                <li>Does scholarly communication on the Web amplify or intensify decentralisation? Or is it the case where scholarly information is easily centralised? How can the workflows in scholarly communication be realised using Web technologies in a decentralised fashion? Do we have the fundamental mechanisms and ability to derive at feasible implementations to adopt a decentralised scholarly Web paradigm?</li>
                <li>Is there a paradigm shift and what is our situation? What are the effects of social Web on scholars? Are the new forms of involvement revive what was once lost? How can scholars participate and exchange information in a decentralised manner?</li>

              <p>The World Wide Web is inherently social. In <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/729965164" title="Chapter 10: Web of People, p123">Weaving the Web</a></cite>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> states that he <q cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/729965164">designed it for a social effect – to help people work together – and not as a technical toy</q>. The Web's remarkable growth is fundamentally due to its social characteristics above anything else.</p>

              <!-- <aside class="note">
                <p>Ironically, one of the weaknesses of the system is also the social centralisation of the Web. For instance, the domain name system is ultimately a hierarchical structure which can be brought down or controlled by an authority; states or people.</p>
              </aside> -->

              <p>Berners-Lee mentions that the challenge in creating a global system was to define the basic common rules of protocol for machines to exchange information.</p>

Interoperability meant that different systems without prior out-of-band knowledge should be able to communicate if they agree to operate based on open standards. Evolvability meant that languages and interfaces need to handle extensions, mixing, accommodate diverse scenarios for information exchange, as well as co-evolve.</p>

                  <p>The Web architecture initially included three independent components:</p>

                    <li>the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ShortHistory.html">Universal Document Identifier</a></cite> (<abbr title="Universal Document Identifier">UDI</abbr>) to refer to information on the Web - now known as <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">Uniform Resource Identifier</a></cite> (<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>) to identify things, and <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738">Uniform Resource Locators</a></cite> (<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>) to locate them on the Web.</li>
                    <li>the <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a></cite> (<abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>) as the request-response mechanism for systems - client–server model - to communicate and exchange hypermedia documents on the Web.</li>

                  </ul>

                  <p>In 2004, the W3C <cite><a href="https://tag.w3.org/">Technical Architecture Group</a></cite> (<abbr title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</abbr>) codifies the design principles, constraints, and good practice notes of the Web architecture in <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One</a></cite> (<abbr title="Architecture of the World Wide Web">AWWW</abbr>). It documents the three architectural bases of the Web: <q>Identification</q>, <q>Interaction</q>, <q>Data Formats</q>, and states that the specifications emerging from each may evolve independently - principle of <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#orthogonal-specs">orthogonality</a></cite> - in order to increase the flexibility and robustness of the Web.</p>

                      <p>In context of the Web, anything - a resource - can be globally identified or named with a URI. As per <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a></cite> the <q cite="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3">generic URI syntax</q> is defined as follows:</p>

                      <pre><span class="highlight-uri">URI</span>         = <span class="highlight-uri-scheme">scheme</span> ":" <span class="highlight-uri-hier-part">hier-part</span> [ "?" <span class="highlight-uri-query">query</span> ] [ "#" <span class="highlight-uri-fragment">fragment</span> ]</pre>

                      <p>The <span class="highlight-uri-hier-part">hierarchical part (<code>hier-part</code>)</span> is composed of <span class="highlight-uri-hier-part"><span class="highlight-uri-hier-part-authority">authority</span></span> and <span class="highlight-uri-hier-part"><span class="highlight-uri-hier-part-path">path</span></span> components.

                      <p>URIs makes it possible for real or abstract objects to be identified. When HTTP URIs are dereferenced different representations (data formats) are made available from corresponding <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738">Uniform Resource Locators</a></cite> (<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>). While URIs makes it possible to identify (name) things on the Web, URLs make it possible for humans and machines to locate and to interact further with content. This paves the way for resources to have a presentation as well as controls such that the information provides the affordances for users of the system to take further actions. When machines are also equipped with the knowledge of handling data formats and their relationships, automated information discovery and creation can be carried out.</p>

                      <p>We refer to W3C's <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/">URIs, URLs, and URNs: Clarifications and Recommendations 1.0</a></cite> from 2001 to distinguish their purpose:</p>

                        <dt>URL</dt>
                        <dd>Any type of URI that can be resolved or dereferenced to locate a representation, eg. an HTTP URI is a URL.</dd>

                        <dd>A specific type of URI that persistently identifies a resource. Once assigned to a resource, it cannot be reassigned.</dd>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>The Web architecture initially used HTML as the language to represent and connect hypermedia documents with one another. HTML's success is indisputable today, and that's perhaps due to its simplicity, to create and reuse; flexibility, for partial understanding to proceed, and; extensibility to allow language mixing. At minimum, HTML proved itself to be a tolerant and durable language that was human-consumable with its default rendering. While the HTML specification continues to evolve by reflecting on the needs of the Web, by design it is scoped to creating and connecting Web documents and applications.</p>

                  <p>Nevertheless, the potential <em>language</em> <q>to describe the interrelationships between things</q> as originally proposed in <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information Management: A Proposal</a></cite> was not realised until the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts">Resource Description Framework</a></cite> (<abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>) came along. RDF is a constructed machine-interpretable language to describe and interlink arbitrary things at any level of abstraction on the Web, and reuses the existing architecture of the Web. Conceptually, RDF was in the fabric of the Web from the start. By comparison, HTML at core is a terse approach to representing and linking knowledge.</p>

                  <p id="aaa">By design, the Web works by <q cite="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDFnot.html#ER">anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</q> (<abbr title="Anyone can say Anything about Anything">AAA</abbr>). One consequence of AAA is that, while systems (and reasoners within) can operate under both the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption">open-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title="Open-world Assumption">OWA</abbr>) or the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption">closed-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title="Closed-world Assumption">CWA</abbr>), the Web ultimately uses the OWA framework because new knowledge can always make its way into the system, and lack of it [knowledge] does not imply falsity. RDF applies a particular restriction of the AAA principle in that nonsensical, inconsistent, or conflicting information can be created or inferred. It is up to processing applications to determine their confidence on the information.</p>

                  <p><em>Statements</em> in RDF can be expressed in the form of <em>triples</em>: <span class="highlight-language-statement"><span class="highlight-language-subject">subject</span>, <span class="highlight-language-predicate">predicate</span>, <span class="highlight-language-object">object</span></span>, where:</p>

                  <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-triples">

                  </blockquote>

                  <p>The <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987">International Resource Identifier</a></cite> (<abbr title="International Resource Identifiers">IRI</abbr>) is a generalisation of URI (US-ASCII) in that a wider character set (Unicode/ISO 10646) can be used to identify resources on the Web. A Blank node (anonymous resource) is a local identifier scoped to the context it is used in, eg. file, RDF store, and they are not intended to be persistent or portable. Literals are used for values like strings, numbers, and dates.</p>

                  <p id="rdf-graph-theory">A set of triples in RDF (an <cite>RDF Graph</cite>) can be represented as a directed edge-labelled graph: <math alttext="upper G equals left-parenthesis upper V comma upper L comma upper E right-parenthesis" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>V</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>L</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>E</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>, where <math alttext="upper V" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow></math> is the set of <e>vertices</e> (union of subject and object terms), <math alttext="upper L" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></math> is a set of edges labels (predicate terms), and <math alttext="upper E" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow></math> contains triples from <math alttext="upper V vector-or-cross-product upper L vector-or-cross-product upper V" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>&#x2a2f;</mo><mi>L</mi><mo>&#x2a2f;</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow></math>. A subject may have several predicates, and predicates can also be mapped to subjects given that they have their own identity.</p>

                  <p>The structure of RDF statements is similar to:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object">subject–verb–object</a></cite> sentence structure in <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_typology">linguistic typology</a></cite> - used by nearly half of human languages</li>
                    <li>the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model">entity–attribute–value</a></cite> (<abbr title="entity–attribute–value">EAV</abbr>) model - widely used for advanced (meta)data modeling</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>We can represent the sentence "<span class="highlight-language-statement"><span class="highlight-language-subject">Otlet</span> <span class="highlight-language-predicate">influenced</span> <span class="highlight-language-object">Berners-Lee</span></span>" in one of the RDF syntaxes as follows:</p>

                  <pre><span class="highlight-language-statement">&lt;<span class="highlight-language-subject" title="subject">http://dbpedia.org/resource/<strong>Paul_Otlet</strong></span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="highlight-language-predicate" title="predicate">http://dbpedia.org/ontology/<strong>influenced</strong></span>&gt; &lt;<span class="highlight-language-object" title="object">http://dbpedia.org/resource/<strong>Tim_Berners-Lee</strong></span>&gt; .</span></pre>

                  <p>RDF facilitates a uniform <q>follow your nose</q> type of exploration by following the semantics in the information provided in order to arrive at another unit of information. Applications can meaningfully interpret and integrate with disparate data without having any out-of-band knowledge, and retrieve more information about the terms.</p>

                  <p>We can describe <span class="highlight-language-subject">Berners-Lee's IRI</span> (subject) by giving it a human-readable <span class="highlight-language-predicate">name</span> (predicate):</p>

                  <pre><span class="highlight-language-statement">&lt;<span class="highlight-language-subject" title="subject">http://dbpedia.org/resource/<strong>Tim_Berners-Lee</strong></span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="highlight-language-predicate" title="predicate">http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name</span>&gt; "<span class="highlight-language-object" title="object">Tim Berners-Lee</span>"<span title="language tag">@en</span> .</span></pre>

                  <div class="note">
                    <h4>Note</h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>While IRIs can be used to identify resources, retrieval mechanisms use URIs because the request URI in HTTP protocol is defined as a URI. Hence, the characters in IRI are first mapped to their URI counterparts before the request process.</p>

                      <p>The terms IRI and URI are used interchangeably outside of technical specifications.</p>

                      <p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing">Natural-language processing</a></cite> (<abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr>) is an area of study concerned with making sense of data that's represented in natural language. The NLP approach would have a different way of making sense of "<span class="highlight-language-subject">Otlet</span>" (a noun) than the declaratively marked noun in RDF using the <span class="highlight-language-subject">IRI for Otlet</span>.</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>

                  <p>In order to address different system and interface needs, different syntaxes for RDF emerged over time, eg. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/">RDF/XML</a></cite> as the grammar to define the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/">XML</a></cite> syntax for RDF graphs; <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a></cite> as the syntax in the natural text form, <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/">RDFa</a></cite> to express RDF statements in markup languages, <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a></cite> to serialize RDF in <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627">JSON</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p>These initiatives are eventually manifested with the <q>Linked Data</q> design principles towards building a <em>Semantic Web</em> where humans and machines can explore the Web of data:</p>

                  <p>The challenges of Web Science involves social and technical aspects, eg user interface to data, information policy, resilience, diverse devices, collective creativity, and decentralisation. This thesis falls into the domain of Web Science as scholarly communication is inherently social and has broad implications across society. In particular, the thesis examines autonomous and interoperable information systems in context of conducting scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                  <p id="global-village">The Web is a medium that is an implementation of a <q>global village</q> that McLuhan describes, through the use of electronic media.

Scholarly communication on the Web happens to be one of the circumstances where different kinds of agents interact, whether they are sentient or something else. All of the four forces and functions have been realised, technically and socially, on the Web.</p>

                <h3>Open Science</h3>
                <p><q>Open Science</q> is a broadly understood notion that is intended to foster <em>open</em> approach to conducting scientific and scholarly work. While there is no single agreed definition of open science, the general consensus is about improving the practice of scientific communication in a transparent, traceable, verifiable, and reusable manner. For all intents and purposes, we can work with the European-funded project <cite><a href="https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/">Facilitate Open Science Training for European Research</a></cite> (<abbr title="Facilitate Open Science Training for European Research">FOSTER</abbr>)'s definition:</p>

                <h3>Archives and Repositories</h3>
                <p>In 1991, recognizing the need for scholars to expedite the exchange of scholarly information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ginsparg">Paul Ginsparg</a> created the <abbr title="Los Alamos National Laboratory">LANL</abbr> preprint archive for <q>e-prints</q>. This provided a moderated central repository where scientists can deposit their articles and have them accessible by anyone, which was a cost-effective solution (estimates were less than 5 USD per submission for administration) for scholars to disseminate research results quickly [<cite><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/pg01unesco.html">Creating a global knowledge network</a></cite>]. It initially started out as a central mailbox with an interface; it adopted FTP in 1991, Gopher in 1992, and finally the World Wide Web in 1994. The articles in the repository are not expected to be peer-reviewed, but rather a place where versioned <q>preprints</q> - considered to precede publications that are peer-reviewed - can be accessed for free. In 2001, the LANL preprint archive eventually became what is currently known as <cite><a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a></cite>. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/license">arXiv license information</a> permits different rights and licenses to be assigned to the scholarly records, ie. anything from public domain, Creative Commons licenses, or with copyright to the publisher or author, provided that arXiv is given sufficient rights to distribute. The repository accepts submissions in TeX, PDF, PostScript, and HTML. This sort of discipline-centric and institution-run preprint exchange mechanism had the technical ingredients to serve as a substitute for the traditional scholarly journal. From 1991 to 2017, arXiv had a <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions">linear increase in submission rate</a> (passing the 1 million mark in 2015). arXiv's early success lead to the emergence of the <a href="#open-archiving">Open Archives Initiative</a> in 1999, and the <a href="#open-access">Open Access</a> movement in 2002.</p>

                <p>After some years of prototyping and researcher-centric initiatives, the ideas eventually formulated into the <cite><a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a></cite> (<abbr title="Budapest Open Access Initiative">BOAI</abbr>) in 2002. BOAI is based on the principle that publicly funded research output should be made immediately available, and indefinitely, without access fees and free from most restrictions on copying and reuse, to increase visibility and uptake:</p>

                <p>In order to open up access to scholarly journal literature, BOAI recommends the adoption of two complementary strategies for open access (<abbr title="Open Access">OA</abbr>):</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><q id="boai-self-archving">I. archives-and-repositories</q> (also called <q>green OA</q>)</li>
                  <li><q id="boai-open-access-journals">II. Open-access Journals</q> (also called <q>gold OA</q>).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><cite><a href="http://cogprints.org/1642/1/nature4.htm">The archives-and-repositories initiative</a></cite> is primarily the act of depositing free copies of <q cite="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">refereed journal articles in open electronic archives</q>. The approach for authors archives-and-repositories was initially implemented through institutional or disciplinary repositories.</p>

                <p>The term <q>self-archiving</q> in context of OA differs from that of the early practices around preprint services in that there were no constraints set for the status of the scholarly literature, ie. reviewed or not. For OA-based scientific literature, certification and quality-control is a requirement, and is paired with the registration and the archive functions of a published literature. With that frame of mind, <q>self-archiving</q> was not intended to be an alias to <q>self-publishing</q>. OA can be considered to have a coupled model with respect to the <a href="#forces-and-functions">four functions in scholarly communication</a> as defined by Roosendaal and Geurts.</p>

                <p>The foundations of the OA approach were conceived at a time where major revenue models to cover publishing costs for scholarly literature was through subsidies from institutions, journal subscriptions, or pay-per-view. In this payment model, consumers of the literature were charged either individually or through institutions. In contrast, the <cite>article processing charge</cite> (<abbr title="Article Processing Charge">APC</abbr>) model requires publication costs to be covered upfront, thereby waiving the costs for the consumers of the literature. The emergence and growing use of APC model provided a stable revenue stream to <em>publishers</em> [<cite><a href="https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.72/"></a></cite>], while the technical infrastructure remained relatively unchanged, ie. print-centric publication formats still prevail. Today, APC is the most widely used method to finance OA publishing, with varying levels of fees - averaging around 1000 USD per article [<cite><a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-124"></a></cite>]).</p>

                <p>The core approach of this thesis is closer to BOAI-1, in that researchers are actively involved in registering, creating awareness, and archiving their scholarly contributions by available means.</p>

                <h3>Deconstructing Scholarly Journal</h3>
                <p>In 1999, <cite><a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/5841/1/DJpaper.pdf">The deconstructed journal – a new model for academic publishing</a></cite> provided insights on the limitations of the networked-based scholarly publishing models:</p>

                <ol>
                  <li><q>means/end</q> confusion, where journals continue to mimic or replicate existing mechanisms</li>
                  <li>modifications to the system should still match the needs of the traditional scholarly journal</li>
                  <li>cooperating agents can function without going through a central agency, eg. a <q>publisher</q>.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The role of the journal includes both <q>main</q> (editorial, quality control, recognition of work, marketing, and disseminating) and <q>hidden</q> (subject and community defining, and archiving) functions. The proposed <em>deconstructed journal</em> model is preferable to the <q>paper</q> influenced electronic publishing model in that both main and hidden roles can be accomplished in a distributed manner. Here, Smith emphasises allowing greater academic freedom and shifting of power and control from the monolithic third-parties to the knowledge producers, which could be realised in either an <em>institution-</em> or <em>researcher-centric</em> approach. To get there, Smith acknowledges that for such a new paradigm to be adopted, professional and funding bodies must transition themselves to accepting the decoupling and self-controlled literature publishing model as something equivalent (in terms of academic value) to the traditional model.</p>

                <p>After two decades, the anecdotal evidence suggests that academia acknowledges the sort of equivalence that Smith describes at varying levels. For example, while literature quality-control can be generally anywhere on the Web, on the other hand, self-published literature remains to be treated as <q>grey literature</q>, ie. any material that is outside of the traditional distribution channels, especially when it comes to academic reward systems.</p>

                <p>In 2012, <cite><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full">Decoupling the scholarly journal</a></cite> presents an analysis of the four functions of scholarly communication. Priem and Hemminger echo the fact that the scholarly journals bundle multiple functions, and that this tight coupling has hindered innovation, is inefficient, and makes it difficult to improve individual functions. The article also states that the <q>current system</q>, ie. the bundling of the closed publishing process and certification models, is unlikely to change if the communication functions are not decoupled, regardless of all the other out-of-band activities such as activism to boycott certain publishers or library subscriptions. The article diverges from the traditional view of separating registration and archiving functions since the latter <q>necessitates both persistent storage and identification</q>. In other words, if a unit of communication is archived, it has also fulfilled registration. The authors echo many of the ideas of Smith with respect to decoupling and decentralisation, however they only go as far as describing them within the context of scholarly functions operating alongside institutional or third-party online services. While they do not exclude the possibility of <em>researcher-controlled</em> operations, neither it is explored. The article concludes that the nature of the communication revolution will be through the structure and organisation of the units in the system. This is analogous to Roosendaal and Geurts' remark on the creation of new information spaces by an ensemble of units of information.</p>

                <p>It is worthwhile to note here that the models that has been described so far primarily focus on <em>institutional</em> or <em>subject</em> repository driven scholarly communication. They are contrasted against the involvement of third-party (for-profit) service providers which impose a particular arrangement of the coupling of the scholarly information space per <em>forces and functions</em>. In the remainder of this thesis, I focus on enabling a <em>researcher-centric</em> model; whilst this can be situated within the same <q>deconstructing</q> or <q>decoupling</q> school of thought, its pursuit is embracing greater control by researchers through the native characteristics of the Web, while still adhering to the scientific method.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>One of the shortcomings of the research publication system is that scientific literature in electronic formats resemble, mimic, and has similar affordances to printed papers. While the paper-centric approach has been adequate - although not necessary optimal - for human consumption and reuse, it has been insufficient for machine-assisted analysis or reuse. The print-centric affordances lack structure that could enable better aggregation, discovery, processing, and integration in which machines excel at, and in turn help with human-led tasks.</p>

                  <p>The most wide use of the term <q>semantic publishing</q> in scientific literature is defined in <cite><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1087/2009202">Semantic publishing: the coming revolution in scientific journal publishing</a></cite> by Shotton. Here the term <q>semantic publishing</q> is constrained to <q>anything that enhances the meaning of a published journal article, facilitates its automated discovery, enables its linking to semantically related articles, provides access to data within the article in actionable form, or facilitates integration of data between papers</q>. The authors of <cite><a href="http://www.tkuhn.org/pub/sempub/sempub.dokieli.html">Genuine Semantic Publishing</a></cite> argue that with respect to the Semantic Web vision, this definition is <q>too restrictive</q> in a sense that it is concerned mainly about narrated information, and <q>too inclusive</q> in that a shallow semantic publication would still qualify, and defer to the fact that the addition of semantics to published works is an established approach. Kuhn and Dumontier argue that the definition for semantic publishing should be broader in that works without narrative are accounted for, and narrow in the sense that semantic representations should be incorporated at the time of creating and publishing entities.</p>

                  <p>The <q>genuine semantic publishing</q> prescribes the notion of publishing 1) <em>machine interpretable</em> formal representations, 2) having <em>essential coverage</em> of the claims, 3) <em>authenticated</em> by the contributors, 4) be a <em>primary</em> component of the work, and 5) be part of <em>fine-grained</em> and <em>light-weight</em> containers.</p>

                  <p>There is more to simply publishing machine-readable scientific data on the Web.

              <p>In recent decades there has been a global shift in communication forms that are used for scientific activities. This perhaps demonstrates a desire for amplification of the senses that are used to consume and create knowledge. For instance, print-centric emphasises the linearity of scientific information representation and its communication, whereas a Web-centric approach makes multimodal interactions possible within the same domain. Scientists need no longer fit their understanding of the world within the confines of static and two-dimensional descriptions of phenomena. The need to travel great distances for first-hand observations and collaboration is also reduced. With electronic media, and more specifically the Web, we have the option to also watch, listen, and participate around measured observations - instantaneously - as the events occur; or after the fact, around persistent and detailed logs. Just as the invention of the printing press transformed the codification and mobility of knowledge, the Web transformed and extended human and machine communication on all fronts. What will be further explored in this thesis is the extent to which our current scholastic activities make use of the inherent qualities of the Web, as well as ways to further take advantage of these qualities.</p>

              <p>In order to help us understand the effects of the Web on scholarly communication, we can use <a href="http://dbpedia.org/Marshall_McLuhan" rel="cito:credits">McLuhan</a>'s tetrad on media effects as a heuristic device, a set of four questions:</p>

              <blockquote cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559" rel="cito:includesQuotationFrom">
                <ul>
                  <li>What does it enhance or intensify?</li>
                  <li>What does it render obsolete or displace?</li>
                  <li>What does it retrieve that was previously obsolesced?</li>
                  <li>What does it produce or become when pressed to an extreme?</li>
                </ul>
                <footer><cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559">Laws of Media</a></cite>, p. 7</footer>
              </blockquote>

              <p>The questions are intended to be complimentary and studied simultaneously. They correspond to four effects: <q>enhances</q>, <q>obsolesces</q>, <q>retrieves</q>, and <q>reverses into</q>. We can use this tetrad to situate the effects and artefacts of scholarly communication on the Web in relation to adjacent mediums, in particular, to print media.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Enhances</dt>
                <dd>access to information, autonomy, decentralisation, distribution, individualism, response time, multi-modality</dd>
                <dt>Obsolesces</dt>
                <dd>isolation, distance, travel, linearity</dd>
                <dt>Retrieves</dt>
                <dd>correspondence, free expression, dialogue, involvement</dd>
                <dt>Reverses into</dt>
                <dd>degraded information quality, group-think, information overload, noise, third-party control</dd>
              </dl>

              <p>The tetrad serves as a conceptual categorisation of effects. It allows us to outline what the medium enables or has implications for at a high level. Verifying, realising, and analysing some of these effects in "the real world", or in day-to-day academic practice, is the core of this thesis. Whilst there exists a plethora of possible observations, this thesis will focus on:</p>

              <ul>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>The scientific communication 'market' is an interplay between actors with an objective to exchange units of information along the lines of: academic literature, analysis, annotations (eg assessments, bookmarks, comments) - datasets, evidence, interactive representations, software, observations, provenance, and workflows. Further, researchers commonly want to expose their work beyond the scientific community to the wider world, seeking adoption or contradiction of new ideas and findings. The analysis provided in <cite><a href="http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/conferences/crisp97/roosendaal.html">Forces and functions in scientific communication</a></cite> provides a framework in which to situate the conceptual and technical contributions in this thesis. This framework has had historical influence on research and development pertaining to technical challenges on interoperability, workflows, service sharing, and information modeling, which is discussed further in <a href="#a-brief-history-of-scholarship-on-the-web">scientific communication on the Web</a> and in the remainder of the thesis.</p>

              <p>Roosendaal and Geurts disassembles the scientific communication market as an interplay between four forces and functions. The dynamics between the forces and functions is formed as a tetrad:</p>

              <h3>Forces</h3>

              <p>The scientific communication market consists of four forces with each having complementary parts: <em>actors</em>, <em>accessibility</em>, <em>content</em>, and <em>applicability</em>.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Actor</dt>
                <dd>Any kind of interactive agent that creates or uses information, eg authors, readers, tool implementers, policy makers, application programs.</dd>
                <dt>Accessibility</dt>
                <dd>The availability and retrievability of information, content accessibility.</dd>
                <dt>Content</dt>
                <dd>The generated questions and answers by actors.</dd>
                <dt>Applicability</dt>
                <dd>Transfer of knowledge to science, technology, and society.</dd>
              </dl>

              <h3>Functions</h3>

              <p>Scientific communication consists of four functions: <em>registration</em>, <em>awareness</em>, <em>certification</em>, and <em>archiving</em>.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Registration</dt>
                <dd>Allows claims of precedence for a scientific activity</dd>
                <dt>Awareness</dt>
                <dd>Remaining informed of the observations</dd>
                <dt>Certification</dt>
                <dd>Establishes the validity of registered claims</dd>
                <dt>Archiving</dt>
                <dd>Preservation of scholarly records over time</dd>
              </dl>

              <p>The actor and content forces are generic and internal to the scholarly market, and are considered to be indispensable in that there would not be a scientific communication market if there are no researchers and the artefacts they exchange. The accessibility and applicability forces on the other hand are external forces because they shape, give purpose to, or influence the activities and content.</p>

              <p>The registration and archiving are objective functions in that they are external to the research process, and considered to be indispensable in that information exchange cannot take place if there are no usable identifiers for the units of communication or if no knowledge preservation measures are put in place. Certification and awareness are subjective communication functions - internal to the research process. Registration and awareness are different aspects of <em>scientific observations</em>, ie. facilitating findable information. Certification and archiving are aspects of <em>scientific judgement</em>, ie. act as a filtering mechanism in the information space.</p>

              <p><cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/vandesompel/09vandesompel.html">Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite> (2004) proposes to revise the notion of a unit of scholarly communication in two ways. In a technological sense, it suggests to recognise the compound and dynamic nature of units that work on the Web, eg. content can be the result of a combination of other registered items, make data available through interactions or depend on acquiring externally registered items. The authors state that in order to empower scholarly communities from a systems perspective, there should be more flexibility on what constitutes a unit of scholarly communication in order to allow registration, as well as factoring timing and the quality of what is to be registered.</p>

              <p>Reflecting on the four forces and functions in 2014, <cite><a href="http://andrew.treloar.net/research/publications/ipres2014/iPres2014-paper.pdf">A Perspective on Archiving the Scholarly Web</a></cite> observes the evolution of scholarly communication on the Web, with regard to the shape and behaviour of the units of information. In essence, the emergence of the Web influenced the communication market by transforming it from predominantly being medium-driven into a content-driven ecosystem. The observation is based on the archival process held on the Web; unplanned and unconstrained archiving, organically occurring, by way of Web objects being deposited across distributed and dedicated archival services. Given the dynamic nature of units of communication on the Web, vertical integration (as per the traditional journal-centric ecosystem), ie. stepping through the four functions in order, turned out to be inadequate. Hence, an affirmation of the outlook as outlined in <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/vandesompel/09vandesompel.html">Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite> that the essential functions need to be <q cite="http://andrew.treloar.net/research/publications/ipres2014/iPres2014-paper.pdf">fulfilled in discreet, disaggregated, and distributed manners, and in which a variety of networked pathways interconnect the autonomous hubs that fulfil these functions</q>. The mere act of <q>recording</q> (or <em>registering</em> in the most general sense) a unit of communication is not a replacement for <em>archiving</em> or persistence, even if the freely available Web services are used towards this end. The article calls for another archival paradigm that is based off the intended characteristics of the Web. That is, given the inherently interlinked and dynamic nature of Web objects, archived resources cannot be treated as atomic resources as they do not necessarily contain the complete content. For instance, a research document referring to external media or interactive scripts, aggregated objects, objects changing their states, or potentially being ephemeral. This is in contrast to the traditional journal-centric approach to archival where all material - physical paper - can be eventually tracked to library stacks. Hence, the future of archiving needs to consider the nature of the object, including the degree in which it can be archived. The complexity and care that is required for the proper preservation of digital objects is further described in <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/rosenthal/11rosenthal.html">Requirements for Digital Preservation Systems</a></cite>, where Rosenthal et al. provide a taxonomy of threat models: software, communication, network, economic, organisational, to name a few, pose a particular risk to permanent information loss that's applicable to the characteristics of the unit as described earlier. Thus, it is important to bare these potential issues in mind starting as we consider what the units will contain and how they will be made available.</p>

              <p>With respect to the four forces and functions, the FAIR principles describe a class of interactions with a particular technical characteristic in scholarly communication. That is.. the 4FF can be done in different ways and FAIR is just one way.. <span class="todo">add things from A brief history of scholarship on the Web</span>.</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Understanding the Medium: Scholarly Communication on the Web</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>In the 1967 book, <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653" rel="schema:url">The Medium is the Massage</a></cite>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote: <q about="" cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653" rel="cito:agreesWith" resource="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653">at the high speeds of electric communication, purely visual means of apprehending the world are no longer possible; they are just too slow to be relevant or effective</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">1</a>]. While McLuhan’s critique was about the effect of the print media in the electric age, it stands especially valid today in the age of interactive new media. For instance, the <em class="cool-media">World Wide Web</em> is a <q>cool media</q> because its access, multi-linearity, and interactive possibilities offer multi-sensory states for individuals. This is in contrast to <em class="hot-media">print</em>, considered to be a <q>hot media</q>, demanding primarily the full attention of our vision. As the printed word’s requirement for the other senses is minimal, it <em>spoon-feeds</em> the content to the reader in a l-i-n-e-a-r <span class="typographic-sine-wave"><span>f</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>h</span><span>i</span><span>o</span><span>n</span></span>. The literate or print culture is passive and is detached from immediate involvement because the medium has no such requirements. The cooler media on the other hand, requires a greater level of engagement from the audience at a faster rate. This increased engagement allows us to detect change and better recognise patterns, which, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping">Gestalt’s laws of grouping</a>, makes the whole of the information easier to follow and understand.</p>

              <p>Modern media, like the Web, offer extensible interactions, creative participation, and social engagement. There is a natural human desire to <strong>connect</strong> and <strong>exchange</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"><em>memes</em></a> (an idea, behaviour, or style) with others, as well as to co-create. Given these opportunities, the fundamental question to ask here is, why should research communication be limited to, evaluated by, and rewarded on methods and practices be based on print-centric media? Scholarly communication still uses methods which date back to the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">mechanical movable type printing press</a> (circa 1450), even in the advent of the globally accessible and interactive new media that are at our fingertips today, and at much faster turnaround times from publication to consumption than ever before. The practices correspond to publication workflows that are in place for academic communication, and have remained largely unchanged for over a century. What does it mean to have an academic achievement through a “publication”? If we consider the Web as a potential supplement to or replacement for these older practices, and given that the Web can be purposed for greater possibilities than print alone, then we also need to address the question, <em>what constitutes a scholarly contribution?</em></p>

              <p>Today, it is evident that the typical publishing scenario for scholarly knowledge predominantly requires strict adherence to the <em>printability</em> aspects of the information eg. <span class="unicode-document">page length, typographical guidelines</span>. That is, all of the encompassing data for any given research and development, ie. noteworthy items which the researcher knows, wants to communicate and demonstrate, must be channeled through the characteristics of the print media. In practice, this leads the research community to use tools that are tailored solely for printing or viewing (on screen). This (sticking to print) leads to unnecessary information loss or arbitrary filtering of the content, which might be otherwise preserved if a different medium was used. Since print is only one possible way to represent and communicate the information, it is worthwhile to investigate and employ alternative or complimentary representations that are more appropriate given the qualities of the Web. Traditional electronic document formats are primarily designed and destined for printing and physical distribution - circulate in scientific circles and on the Web, we can make one observation: such formats, on the hot end of the media spectrum, are trying to exist and remain relevant inside a cool medium.</p>

              <p>The intention is not to undermine the values of the print-centric approach, but rather to explore alternative media and their different qualities. <q cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/250420453" title="McLuhan, M. and H.

              <p>The concepts and ideas discussed so far in this chapter cover various aspects of the scholarly communication ecosystem, and in many cases ideas from different sources and different times overlap. I now take this related work, along with the context of the modern Web and the current state of scholarly communication, and use these to formulate the <cite><a href="https://linkedresearch.org/">Linked Research</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Research">LR</abbr>) initiative. This comprises foremost a set of principles intended to describe a researcher-centric information and interaction space optimised for scholarly communication on the Web. We will refer and reflect on these principles for the other contributions of this thesis.</p>

              <p>It quickly becomes clear that these principles build on existing ideas, but also in many cases are developed further and push for a future free from the constraints of academic publishing models tied to media from the past, as well as a strive to enable content creators to exercise their creativity to the fullest extent possible in order to affectively communicate.</p> 

              <p>LR is also set up as a community effort, and here I present a snapshot of work which is expected to continue to develop as others contribute and more diverse voices bring their requirements to the table. For now, I acknowledge the bias towards Western (Euro and US centric) academic practices in the domain of Computer Science.</p>

                    <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                      <p>The systems that are designed to fulfill the functions in scholarly communication should operate with the expectation of autonomous participation. One value that can be upheld through the principle of autonomy is to not have any constraints on where units of communication can exist on the Web. For instance, the actors of a system can have the freedom to designate identifiers to their artefacts: profile(s), articles, annotations, notifications, and so forth, as well as where they can be retrieved from. Similarly, the actor's autonomy to use preferred applications to interact with data. We consider that <em>decentralisation</em> of the information space is a means to gain autonomy on the Web. Ultimately, autonomy is the right to freely choose and maintain sovereignty over URI ownership and data spaces, and the ability to use or switch between applications that can interact with them. Likewise, actors' autonomy would not obstruct them to use shared dataspaces if they so desire.</p>

                      <p>On the Web, any entity is entitled to associate a URI with a resource in accordance with <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#uri-ownership">URI ownership</a></cite>. It follows that any type of object, eg. scientific literature, research objects, personal websites and social graphs, can be made available on the Web provided that the <em>actors</em> have sufficient control over their URIs, or trust in others entities which do. While URI ownership is socially and technically within the reach of most academics, putting it into practice paves the way to a more decentralised use of the scholarly information space. Through URI ownership, decentralisation through deconstructing and decoupling can take place.</p>

                      <p>URI ownership is architecturally decentralised in that the location of a resource can physically exist anywhere in the world. However, architectural decentralisation is ultimately influenced by political or social centralisation at different levels. The <cite><a href="https://www.icann.org/">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a></cite> (<abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>) coordinates the management of <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034">domain names</a></cite>, where top-level domains for like <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc920">countries, categories, multiorganization</a>, are then under the authority of specific organisations. Individuals then typically register fully qualified domain names (and map them to <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses) through accredited registries.</p>

                      <p>The contents of HTTP URLs may be logically centralised or decentralised. For example, the media representations found at the URL can embed compound or dynamic components that are dependent on external (remote) URLs. In this particular case, the persistence of the external URLs, as well as whether their contents are immutable is a design concern.</p>

                      <p>Autonomy is an important ingredient to fully exercise freedom of expression. If a URI is governed by a third-party entity, ie. other than the researcher who shares the contents of a scientific resource, then it is possible that the URLs may no longer resolve, and the content may be subject to change in ways beyond researcher's control. Whereas without intermediaries, the researcher has sufficient ownership and control as to what happens at their URI space. A by-product of this ability is the notion of <em>self-registration</em> with respect to the registration function. Trust in this case is placed on the Web space that is closer to the owners of the URI and URL space, or publisher of units of communication.</p>

                      <p>The concerns about authenticity, persistence and permanence of data and knowledge is constant regardless of where the resources reside on the Web. Hence, strictly trusting scholarly knowledge based on its registered location is ultimately fragile in that it is unavoidable to prevent all sorts of threats to preservation in a long enough timeline. However, as the registration function is decoupled from archiving, we are able to delegate that trust to a "third-party" that is best fit to handle the preservation and authenticity of the units of communication. This is particularly important if archival and the sense of trust is considered to be part of the global scholarly commons.</p>

 <!-- This is further explored in the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Evolution.html#ToII">Test of Independent Invention</a></cite> thought experiment. -->

                      <p>In context of the Web, technical or social decentralisation at all levels is unattainable. Even Web standards are a form of centralisation in that conforming systems can only coordinate among themselves. Similarly, centralisation naturally occurs in social systems like concepts or language, eg. machine-readable vocabularies restrict the set of uses of a system. The alternative pushed to the extreme where we each unit is expressed in their own language puts us in a situation similar to that of the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">Tower of Babel</a></cite>, ie. being incapable of understanding each other. Hence, autonomy in a system where researchers are isolated or information is not interpretable renders freedom of expression meaningless.</p>

                      <p>In context of publishing, we refer to the registration function that is irrespective of any certification or acknowledgement of the quality of work. Hence, when a researcher initiates registration, we refer to that as <q>self-registration</q>. The act of self-publishing eg. at one's own website, is effectively self-registration. Individuals can and should have autonomy over their own contributions without infringing on the autonomy of others.</p>

                      <p>Just as an object can have multiple global identifiers on the Web, autonomous registration in and itself does not interfere with multiple or other forms of registration across systems. For instance, a unit of communication can be simultaneously registered through systems with different capabilities and expectations that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. To name a few, autonomous URI spaces for personal or preferred, community managed persistence, institutional or organisational - typically due to publicly or privately-funded research.</p>

                      <p>While we aim for autonomous systems, we also seek interoperability and cooperation for actual communication take to place via universal access and interpretable information.</p>

The goal is to provide a reliably mutually consistent expression of the content. For human-centric scholarly communication to thrive, units of communication should be targeted to aim to meet highest level of conformance criteria.

                      <p>Information should be <strong>interpretable</strong> and <strong>interactive</strong> in that different interfaces for the media can be available for different kinds of agents; human, machine, or other.</p>

                      <p>While decentralised systems enables each entity to be autonomous, some level of agreement (federation) is needed on the network for communication to take place. Interoperability is at the core of achieving cooperative systems. One widely successful approach to have interoperable systems it through the adoption of open standards for protocols and formats for information exchange. Systems that are interoperable by design have the benefit of interacting with other systems without having prior out-of-band knowledge about them.</p>

                      <p>This can be contrasted with systems and data that conducts <em>post-facto interoperability</em> typically due to propriety designs. For example, given two systems, one system adopts the others' protocol, API, or format, or they build specialised "bridge" in order to communicate. Systems not using open standards or have specialised technological extensions that are only useful within their own environment or procedures are considered to be vendor lock-in.</p>

                      <p>Systems vary on their degree of interoperability. For instance, a service may require their own user account or authentication mechanism to be used when interacting with data on the Web; users may have to use a particular application to access, create, share or reuse information; applications may need to be reconfigured to reuse the information that is created elsewhere. In the <a href="#acid-test">acid test</a> we discuss how to assess accessibility and interoperability of tooling and services scholarly communication.</p>

                      <p>In order to have optimal means of discovery, exchanging, and reusing information, systems and data should opt for open standards and widely acknowledged best practices wherever possible. Linked Data technologies include the essentials to achieve this, and are well-suited to fulfill the four functions of scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                      <p>Scientific contributions are multimodal, interactive, and social.</p>

                  <p>We first approach the forces and functions of scholarly communication in context of the Linked Research design principles.</p>

                    <dd>
                      <p>We expect that systems by design should allow any actor to register a unit of information by associating an IRI with a distinct resource. For example, an actor can assign an IRI for their research literature at an information space they have ownership or control, eg. personal or university website, creating an archived copy, entry in a dataset, annotated video fragment, producing notifications, or even referring to a resource that will be available in the future.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>Identifying units on the Web can be done with kinds of social contracts. Here we discuss a few that pertain to registration:</p>

                  <p id="purl"><cite><a href="">Persistent Uniform Resource Locator</a></cite> (<abbr title="Persistent Uniform Resource locator">PURL</abbr>) is a way to provide an HTTP URL a permanent redirect to another HTTP URL.

                  <p id="w3id">Similar to PURLs, is the W3C <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/community/perma-id/">Permanent Identifier Community Group</a></cite>'s resulting <cite><a href="https://w3id.org/">w3id.org</a></cite>, where a group of entities that pledge to ensure the operation of the community-drive service. w3id.org provides a permanent URL re-direction service, and it can be done by making a request to register and update a URI path.

                  <p id="doi"><cite><a href="https://doi.org/">Digital Object Identifier</a></cite> (<abbr title="Digital Object Identifier">DOI</abbr>) is an international standard for document identification, and the services that are offered through doi.org is managed by the International DOI Foundation (at the time of this writing). The foundation permits <a href="http://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html">registration agencies</a> to manage DOI records. In order to have a resource assigned with a DOI, it has to be done through one of the DOI registration agencies. Given the statement in <cite>AWWW</cite>, <q><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-persistence">URI persistence is a matter of policy and commitment on the part of the URI owner</a></q>, DOI introduces an additional layer of social contract to govern the discovery of scientific artefacts. A DOI is aimed at being a persistent identifier for an object it is assigned to, and has the mechanism to refer to the URL of an object where it can be found. That is, a DOI may refer to a landing page about the actual object and not necessarily the object itself; the latter happens to be a common practice in the scholarly information space. For literature that has restricted access, the resolved DOI is typically a webpage where an actor would need to go through the system's <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> in order to retrieve the content. For open literature, the resolved DOI would generally hyperlink to the actual scientific object in human-interpretable only fashion, or be part of a webpage accompanied by material unrelated to the scientific object itself, ie. information that the scientists neither assembled as part of their research nor intended for the consumer. If the actual URL of the object changes, the DOI's lookup table for the URL has to be updated. Otherwise, they'll point to dead links or unrelated information.</p>

                  <p id="orcid"><cite><a href="https://orcid.org/">Open Researcher and Contributor ID</a></cite> (<abbr title="Open Researcher and Contributor ID">ORCID</abbr>) is a persistent identifier for scientists, academic authors and contributors. An ORCID ID is specified as an URI. While anyone can create and update their ORCID profile, the identifier is ultimately owned and managed by the ORCID organisation and made available through <code>orcid.org</code>. While where each researcher has their online profiles is at their discretion, it has a natural constraint on what their profile can ultimately express. For most intents and purpose, the free service offered by ORCID is sufficient for most researchers, it has provides a mechanism where researchers can extend their profile descriptions by linking to their other online profiles. One unintended consequence of this popular centralisation in scholarly communication is that a growing number of institutions and publishers require researchers to participate with their ORCID IDs, as opposed to any URI on the Web. The resulting effects of <a href="https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter">such initiatives</a> are counter to LR design principles. At the same time, the administration of the URI by the ORCID organisation removes the burden of maintaining the URI as well as the profile URL. In this case, a "trusted" third-party takes care of the identifier, where as the researcher takes cares of the content made available at the URL.</p>

              <p>The Web is capable of offering rich interactions for humans and machines. While scientists have adopted the Web as an ideal medium to exchange knowledge, I posit that it is not being used efficiently or optimally due to both social and technical reasons. What we can ask is if it is possible to use the medium to its full potential, and observe the <em>effects</em>. We can also consider the consequences of pushing this to the extreme - as per McLuhan's <em>reverses into</em>. LR is not only a set of design principles to shape the technical scholarly communication ecosystem, but an initiative to strive to experience the full effects of the Web by adopting what it has to offer. In part, LR is an attempt to actively break away from practices which enhance isolationism. Technologies that enable or enhance the social dimensions on the Web for example makes involvement with content possible. The design principles are nudge towards this.</p>

              <p>LR is also a conceptual framework that describes how implementations in scholarly communication can interoperate. Its philosophy is influenced by the social machinery to build a knowledge Web for humans and machines as part of a cooperating system. Knowledge tends to get lost if it can't be retrieved, hence it has limited value. This is particular why a holistic approach to universal access for all agents is an important criteria.</p>

              <p>Is LR a yet another model? Not exactly. Its design is in agreement with certain qualities of the existing works and practices in the wild. However, LR looks at the problem space by revisiting the characteristics of the medium, and what the actors can achieve in context of scientific communication. Arbitrary or artificial barriers are anti-patterns.</p>

              <p>Are there ideological and technology traps? The <em>traps</em> can be seen as analogous to McLuhan's <q>reverses into</q> effect. When the LR design principles are pushed to the extreme, highly specialised and fine-grained centralised systems can and will emerge while still operating within the larger <q>decentralised</q> system on the Web. We see this with social media [citation needed]. The degree of federation or interoperability among these systems will vary. The effects may be that of a new generation of third-party control and authority over certain information spaces. For example, just as centralised publishing and distribution services currently exist for the dominating paper-centric industry, the medium can still accommodate similar control over semantic and granular scientific resources. It is worthwhile to note that the ecosystem would only become more diverse as it expands.</p>

              <p>While the criteria for publishing provided by <cite>Genuine Semantic Publishing</cite> is valuable and can also be exercised by following LR's <q>interpretable and interactive</q> design principle, we do not prescribe it in order to not conflict with the <q>freedom of expression</q> principle. If a third-party imposes a specific way to express knowledge, whether it is through file formats and their structure and semantics; what (meta)data to include or not include; or inclusion and use of interactive components; the quality of the communication will suffer because the author may have to make compromises. Information loss occurs and communication quality naturally degrades simply because what the actors wish to convey in their message, and how, will have to be filtered down in order to fit the requirements of a third-party.</p>

              <p>At the time of this writing, LR's principles were conceived within the Web paradigm, as opposed to the broader Internet. There are emerging technologies and platforms within the Internet which are highly specialised for security, versioning, distributed, and so forth, which give way to new possibilities on how the scholarly communication market can be realised. While this thesis fits LR's principles into particular contemporary technology stacks, this is for practical purposes and to demonstrate what can be achieved today. Nothing prevents the principles from being adopted under different environments. It is quite likely that the design philosophies of the new environments will differ.</p>

              <!-- <p>What is the scope? What are some of the instabilities or inadequate use of the system? What is missing or could use more development/attentions?</p>  -->

              <p>Sooner or later we need a strategy to address questions like: <em>What do we aim to accomplish?</em> <em>Who is trying to do it and for the benefit of whom?</em> <em>How do we know whether we are making progress and when we have succeeded?</em></p>

              <p>Potential solutions to these questions and new challenges need to address the connection and the gap between researchers, academic and public institutions, as well as what ends up in the commons. It is not just about researchers making their contributions available on the Web, or about conferences requesting semantically annotated contributions, or operating with transparent peer-review. All of these things must move in combination. To lay out the roles of various actors in the ecosystem when it comes to fulfilling the LR principles:</p>

              <dl>
                <dt id="working-together-researchers">Researchers</dt>
                <dd>Researchers take full responsibility of their contributions. This can be at any Webspace they put trust on or have sufficient authority over, eg. personal site, institutions’ student and faculty pages. Making their work as <q>Webby</q> as possible eg. linking their arguments and citations to others', interactive story-telling or experimentation possibilities for their readers. Researchers should take special care to ensure URI persistence and archiving of their work.</dd>

                <dt id="working-together-conferences-and-journals">Conferences and journals</dt>
                <dd>In person conferences and online journals should encourage and accept research publications which use native Web technologies. Support transparent and attributed peer-review process. Aggregation or proceedings of the events should be machine-friendly and archival measures should be taken in addition to those of researchers.</dd>

                <dt id="working-together-public-institutions">Public institutions</dt>
                <dd>Given sufficient evidence of the Web Science community’s acknowledgement of research as well as its contributions, eg. peer-reviews, academic institutions should officially acknowledge such work towards academic credit. Libraries should make the community’s output discoverable, catalogued, enriched, among many other things.</dd>

              <p><cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/611804138" rel="cito:reviews">The Printing Press as an Agent of Change</a></cite>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Eisenstein">Eisenstein</a>, 1979, traces the impact of the communications revolution on a variety of sociocultural movements that shaped the modern mind that started by the invention of the printing press developed by Johannes Gutenberg (circa 1439). Eisenstein demonstrates that the printing press, as a technological innovation, was a potent force in the evolution of social systems, as well as a communication technology which intensified the evolutionary process in the storage and dissemination of information and data. Perhaps more generally, Eisenstein explains how <q>printing altered <em>written communications within the Commonwealth of Learning</em></q>, p. xiv.</p>

              <p>With the growing power of the printing press since the 15th century, and sufficiently large international readers across Europe, the mass production and distribution of printed material gave rise to the formation of intellectuals as a distinct and independent social class. The long-distance, international, and private correspondence network between the literary figures formed the basis for the concepts, <cite>Commonwealth of Learning</cite>; vernacular science-writing in Latin aimed at non-academic readers, as well as aiding the literary <q>underground</q> trade among researchers to propel theories and data collection, and the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Letters">Republic of Letters</a></cite> (<abbr title="Republic of Letters">RoL</abbr>) - used interchangeably with <q>men of letters</q> and <q>literati</q>, derived from the French term <q lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">homme de lettres</q> - refers to a metaphysical <em>literary</em> society that produced and had access to substantial (non)scientific knowledge in Europe and America in the 17th century, p. 136-139.</p>

              <p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society">The Royal Society</a></cite> (<abbr title="The Royal Society">RS</abbr>) effectively established authority for a metaphysical community for scientists and scholars. In essence, it acknowledge and legitimised the social activity in RoL, and acted as a way to filter and help disseminate the discoveries of the literati. <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_des_s%C3%A7avans">Journal des sçavans</a></cite> published in 1665 was the first academic journal in Europe, followed by <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</a></cite> in the same year. The first journal that strongly focused on scientific communication came later with the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptes_rendus_de_l%27Acad%C3%A9mie_des_Sciences">Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences</a></cite> in 1666.</p>

              <p>Due to societal circumstances, eg. sponsorship and censorship by authorities, the literary underground with the help of the printing press was well underway in the 16th century. By 1640 <q>science had risen</q> mostly in the underground, and well pre-dated the discovery and improvement of the telescope p. 685; the RoL; and the establishment of the RS. With the help of the RS later on, new discoveries and theories were disseminated abroad, p. 664.</p>

              <p>Eisenstein postulates that the printed book played a central role in the <q>rapid dissemination of knowledge to whole new classes that created the modern new attitudes to both science and religion at the end of the fifteenth century.</q> The mere availability of prior knowledge to the public, stimulated scientific curiosity further, and eventually gave birth to the scientific revolution, p. 691. Eisenstein also contends that the communication shift in technical literature occurred even before astronomers changed their views about the structure of the universe, p. 685. Moreover, the origins of the scientific revolution was partly due to the rediscovery of classical scientific texts, and the effects of an internal strife between academic innovators and conservationists (<q>quarrels of learned men</q>), trying to control the field of knowledge outside of academia, p. 523-524, 570. Eisenstein emphasises on the <q>relevance of external social institutions to the internal, relatively autonomous, life of science</q>, p. 636, as well as the utilitarian <q>application of the mathematics to the problems of the natural world</q>, p. 683.</p>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Autonomy</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>The systems that are designed to fulfill the functions in scholarly communication should operate with the expectation of autonomous participation. One value that can be upheld through the principle of autonomy is to not have any constraints on where units of communication can exist on the Web. For instance, the actors of a system can have the freedom to designate identifiers to their artefacts: profile(s), articles, annotations, notifications, and so forth, as well as where they can be retrieved from. Similarly, the actor's autonomy to use preferred applications to interact with data. It can be considered that <em>decentralisation</em> of the information space is <em>a</em> means to gain autonomy on the Web. With respect to <em>delocalisation</em>, certain kinds of resources, eg. personal Web identifiers (WebID) controlled by their owners, can be used across different systems as they need not be tied to any particular URI space or system, and are free from external influences. Ultimately, autonomy is the right to freely choose and maintain sovereignty over URI ownership and data spaces, and the ability to use or switch between applications that can interact with them. Likewise, actors' autonomy would not obstruct them to use shared URI spaces if they so desire.</p>

                  <p>Any type of object, eg. scientific literature, research objects, personal websites, profiles and social graphs, can be made available on the Web provided that the <em>actors</em> have sufficient control over their URIs, or delegate to entities they trust. While URI ownership is socially and technically within the reach of most academics, putting it into practice paves the way to a more decentralised and delocalised approach to using scholarly information spaces. Through URI ownership, decentralisation through deconstructing and decoupling can take place.</p>

                  <p>The contents of HTTP URLs may be logically centralised or decentralised. For example, the media representations found at the URL can embed compound or dynamic components that are dependent on external (remote) URLs. In this particular case, the persistence of the external URLs, as well as whether their contents are immutable is a design concern.</p>

                  <p>Autonomy is an important ingredient to fully exercise <em>freedom of expression</em>, which is a civil liberty. If a URI is governed by a third-party entity, ie. other than the researcher who shares the contents of a scientific resource, then it is possible that the URLs may no longer resolve, and the content may be subject to change in ways beyond researcher's control. Whereas without intermediaries, the researcher has sufficient access and control as to what happens at their URI space. This gives actors the ability to exercise <em>self-registration</em> with respect to the registration function. Trust in this case is placed on the Web space that is closer to the "owners" of the URI and the publisher of the retrievable representations.</p>

                  <p>The right to have <em>freedom of expression</em> necessitates that the articulation of scholarly contributions are not subject to arbitrary interference from third-parties, and allow actors to seek the most appropriate ways to co-create and co-participate. We inherit:</p>

                  <blockquote cite="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">
                    <h5>Article 19.</h5>

                    <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</p>

                    <footer><cite><a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a></cite></footer>
                  </blockquote>

                  <p id="freedom-of-expression-constraints">Freedom of expression in context of academic communication does not entail that any arbitrary artefact eg. self-published articles, passes quality-control and certification from the community, or ethically appropriate. By free expression, I mean that actors should not be subject to <em>technical constraints</em> on how they communicate their discoveries and knowledge with the rest of the world. That is, to have the means to <em>shape</em> machine-readable structure and semantics, presentation, and interactions. Enrolling in the certification process of some literature can for instance mean that reviewers may engage in any aspect and granularity of the contribution itself, eg. a weakness for an argument in one literature can be contrasted (and linked) with a scientific result presented in another literature. Academic freedom to express entails that researchers caring out their work comply with discipline-specific methods and meet standards related to accuracy, precision, completeness, reliability, relevance, and so forth. Furthermore, as with human rights, the ability to express does not grant unethical practices at the expense of any person or group, nor should be tolerated. Similarly, technical expressions that are harmful or discriminatory, eg. inaccessible content, constrained presentations, or undesirable user interactions, should be avoided.</p>

                  <p>The concerns about authenticity, persistence and permanence of data and knowledge is constant regardless of where the resources reside on the Web. Hence, strictly trusting scholarly knowledge based on its registered location is ultimately fragile in that it is unavoidable to prevent all sorts of threats to preservation in a long enough timeline. However, since the registration function is decoupled from archiving, we are able to delegate that trust to a third-party that is best fit to handle the preservation and to some extent guarantee the authenticity of the units of communication. This is particularly important as archival and trust are part of the global scholarly commons.</p>

                  <p>In context of the Web, technical or social decentralisation at all levels is unattainable. Even open Web standards are based on social and technical decisions, and can be seen as a form of centralisation in that conforming systems cluster and coordinate among themselves. Similarly, centralisation naturally occurs in social systems like concepts or language, eg. machine-readable vocabularies restrict the set of uses of a system. The alternative pushed to the extreme where each unit is expressed in their own language and without any language mapping, puts us in a situation similar to that of the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">Tower of Babel</a></cite>, ie. being incapable of understanding each other. Hence, autonomy in a system where researchers are isolated or information is not interpretable renders freedom of expression meaningless.</p>

                  <p>A globally democratic scientific and scholarly inquiry and progress fundamentally depends upon a well-informed citizenry. For societies to be well informed, the people must have ready access to information about the knowledge output of the scholarly community, the actions of the public officials based on available knowledge, and the development of public policies. The philosophical underpinnings of the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information">Freedom of Information</a></cite> (<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>) social movement trace back to the Age of Enlightenment. Over the centuries, governments have incorporated constitutional, legal, and historical expressions of the people's right to public information. A global freedom of information movement can be traced to the <cite>World Press Conference</cite> in 1893. The movement revolved around the need for unrestricted "access to news at its source and free transmission" of the news - <cite>Freedom of Information Laws</cite>, p.53-54, urn:isbn:0123876729. A parallel movement in scholarly communication today is under the umbrella of <cite><a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#open-science">Open Science</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p><em>Universal access</em> to information can be attributed to two distinct but related areas:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>freedom to inquire; the right and means to access information</li>

                  <p>The <abbr title="Architecture of the World Wide Web">AWWW</abbr> states that agents, <em>interpret</em> available <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#dereference-details">representation according to the data format specification that corresponds to the representation's Internet Media Type.</q> Here we can use the term <em>interpretation</em> in the general sense for both human and machine consumers of representations. An interpretation entails that a given content can be identified or discovered; comprehended in context of where and how it is used; as well being to put it to further use. Scientific and scholarly knowledge representations using information models that are based on Web standards brought through open consensus benefit from wide reuse.</p>

                  <p id="interoperability"><strong>Interoperability</strong> is integral to achieving cooperative systems. One widely successful approach to have interoperable systems is through the adoption of open standards for protocols and languages that is achieved through consensus. As per Linked Data design principles, this is accomplished with HTTP for communication, URI for identification, and RDF as language. While a decentralised system can enable each entity to be autonomous, some level of agreement is needed on the network for communication to take place. Systems that are interoperable by design have the benefit of interacting with other systems without having prior and out-of-band knowledge about them. This kind of interoperability can be contrasted with <em>post-facto</em> interoperability that is typically due to propriety designs at the discretion of each party, and then bridging the systems with application adapters and semantic mappings. For example, given two systems, one system adopts the others' protocol, API, or format, or they build specialised mechanisms in order to communicate. Systems that do not use open standards or have specialised technological extensions that are only useful within their own environment are generally considered to be vendor lock-in solutions. Here we seek agreements on Web standards established through open consensus, as opposed to independent and individual design choices made in application implementations.</p>

                  <p>Systems vary on their degree of interoperability. For instance, a service may require their own user account or authentication mechanism to be used when interacting with data on the Web; users may have to use a particular application to access, create, share or reuse information; applications may need to be reconfigured to reuse the information that is created elsewhere. In the <a href="#acid-test">Acid Test</a> section I propose criteria to self-assess accessibility and interoperability of artefacts in scholarly communication.</p>

                  <p>There is a natural balance between having free expression of structure and semantics (through autonomy) and the degree of a communication (interoperability) among different parties to take place. At the same time, as centralisation of ideas is ultimately inescapable, interoperability influences or limits the choices a system can take. Hence, we embrace the notion of interoperability as a trade-off, ie. it is better to seek and adapt design patterns that are expected or intended to be better for the ecosystem as a whole than to adopt patterns that avoid this possibility. Hence, interoperability is a social construct with the intention of balancing autonomy and cooperative systems.</p>

                  <p>In order to have optimal means of discovery, exchanging, and reusing information, systems and data should opt for open standards and widely acknowledged best practices wherever possible. Linked Data technologies include some of the essentials to achieve this, and are well-suited to fulfil the four functions of scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

              <p>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover relations. The knowledge industry can better address societal challenges by embracing the virtues of the Web via decentralisation and interconnectivity of our collective knowledge.</p>

              <p>The <dfn id="lorc">Linked Open Research Cloud</dfn> (<abbr title="Linked Open Research Cloud">LORC</abbr>) project aims to increase the awareness, discovery, and reuse of resources about scholarly communication on the Web in the form of open <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData">Linked Data</a></cite>. It pursues this by accepting notifications about scholarly activities, making them available for reuse, and generates an interactive visualisation for additional exploration. Consequently, LORC can assist researchers with their applications to discover pertinent scholarly information on the Web, and connect their knowledge with the global knowledge graph. For the wider scientific community, LORC can facilitate scientometrics studies and decision making based on the scholarly commons ecosystem.</p>

              <p>To this end, this article announces its <em>inbox</em> to receive <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Notifications">LDN</abbr>) about scholarly activities, eg. publication of scholarly articles, <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">Web Annotations</a></cite> (like peer reviews, replies), citations, call for contributions, proceedings, scientific observations and workflows, arguments, funding information etc. With a system like LORC, universal scientific knowledge can be better connected, findable, and accessible, with the potential to amplify its effectiveness and efficiency.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>In order to demonstrate the extensibility of Linked Data centric units of communication within context of Linked Research, I extend the LDN <a href="linked-data-notifications#test-suite-and-implementation-reports">test suite and implementation reports</a> and <a href="linked-data-notifications#linked-data-notifications-implementations">implementations</a> and describe the development of an interlinked, human and machine-readable W3C Recommendation, its test suite, and implementation reports as a whole.</p>

              <p>Having the specifications and implementation reports appropriately interlinked and retrievable can facilitate their automated discovery and reuse. One attainable use case is to be able to find applications that match a certain conformance criteria, eg. in order to have fine-grained bundling of software packages. While this would typically include normative requirements, tests can potentially capture and reveal optional features of specifications. Prospective consumers of the compliance reports can be application developers finding appropriate software for use, as well as automatic software package managers.</p>

              <p>The information patterns in the LDN <a href="#specification">specification</a> and the <a href="linked-data-notifications#test-suite-and-implementation-reports">implementation reports</a> sections are reusable across other specifications and related components. Sources are available from:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The specification: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/</a></li>
                <li>The test suite: <a href="https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/">https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/</a></li>
                <li>Implementation reports summary and individual reports: <a href="https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary">https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary</a></li>
              </ul>

              <p>The test suite uses the <cite><a href="https://github.com/csarven/mayktso">mayktso</a></cite> server as the LDN receiver, but any conformant receiver implementation will work here.</p>

              <p>The missing connection among existing specifications and test reports is that a uniform resource discovery is not possible between the test reports and the individual conformance criteria in the specifications, where a given information at a particular URL is both human and machine-processable (see <cite><a href="http://csarven.ca/linked-specifications-reports#related-work">related work</a></cite>.)</p>

              <p>The key takeaways are:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Human and machine-readable documents via HTML+RDFa are feasible for specifications and implementation reports.</li>
                <li>The connection between EARL and the QB vocabulary is suitable for multi-dimensional data without having to define new component specifications for the data cube.</li>
                <li>Individual observations (test results) can be identified and discovered through contextual links in the specification, with the use of EARL and QB vocabularies.</li>
                <li>The LDN protocol can support the possibility to send, receive and consume notifications about the implementation reports, as well as help with their discovery and reuse.</li>
                <li>It is possible for other documents to refer to specific parts of the specification, test suite and reports.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>LR is an initiative to strive to experience the full effects of the Web by observing and making use of its affordances. It serves as a conceptual framework that describes how actors can control their interactions and data, as well as how decentralised and socially-aware applications can exchange information.</p>

              <p>Are there ideological and technology traps? The traps can be seen as analogous to McLuhan's <q>reverses into</q> effect. When the LR design principles are pushed to the extreme, highly specialised and fine-grained centralised systems can and will emerge while still operating within the larger decentralised system on the Web. The degree of federation or interoperability among the autonomous systems will vary. The effects may be that of a new generation of third-party control and authority over certain information spaces. For example, just as centralised publishing and distribution services currently exist for the dominating paper-centric industry, the medium can still accommodate similar control over semantic and granular scientific resources. It is worthwhile to note that the ecosystem would only become more diverse as it expands. Entropy is an inherent property of the Web.</p>

              <p>It is worthwhile to note here that the existing models for information exchange that has been described so far primarily focus on institutional or subject repository driven scholarly communication. They are contrasted against the involvement of third-party (for-profit) service providers which impose a particular arrangement of the coupling of the scholarly information space per <em>forces and functions</em>. In the remainder of this thesis, I focus on enabling a <strong>researcher-centric</strong> model; whilst this can be situated within the same <q>deconstructing</q> or <q>decoupling</q> school of thought, its pursuit is embracing greater control by content creators through the native characteristics of the Web, without interfering with the certification function regardless of the academic discipline; humanities, social, natural, formal, or applied sciences. The notion of content creators or consumers having some control on accessibility, registration and archiving, inherits certain qualities of coupling. That is, researcher-centric coupling unleashes the potentials of expressivity and effective scholarly communication.</p>

              <p>While the criteria for publishing provided by <cite>Genuine Semantic Publishing</cite> is valuable and can also be exercised by following LR's <q>interpretable</q> design principle, we do not prescribe it in order to not conflict with the <q>freedom of expression</q> principle. If a third-party imposes a specific way to express knowledge, whether it is through file formats and their structure and semantics; what (meta)data to include or not include; or inclusion and use of interactive components; the quality of the communication is subject to be less effective because the author may have to make compromises. Information loss occurs and communication quality naturally degrades simply because what the actors wish to convey in their message, and how, will have to be filtered down in order to fit the requirements of a third-party, data formats, or user interfaces.</p>

              <p>At the time of this writing, LR's principles and the strive for interoperable systems is conceived within the Web paradigm, as opposed to the broader Internet. There are emerging technologies and platforms within the Internet which are highly specialised for security, versioning, distributed, and so forth, which give way to new possibilities on how the scholarly communication market can be realised. While this thesis fits LR's principles into particular contemporary technology stacks, this is for practical purposes and to demonstrate what can be achieved today. Nothing prevents the principles from being adopted under different environments. It is quite likely that the design philosophies of the new environments will differ.</p>

              <p class="todo">What is the scope? What are some of the instabilities or inadequate use of the system? What is missing or could use more development/attentions?</p>

              <p class="todo">We all produce and distribute information. It is our part of our nature. What kinds of rules would serve everyone's (writers and readers) needs in the Web environment? What may be the constrains?</p>


              <p>LR does not deconstruct scholarly publishing, but that it ironically indicates instead the need for a counter-environment as a means of practising the dominant and unnoticed environment.</p>


              <p>One of the effects of LR is that it is an attempt to formalise what is considered to be "informal" communication due the typical coupling of the functions by third-parties in scholarly communication.</p>

              <p>Sooner or later we need a strategy to address questions like: <em>What do we aim to accomplish?</em> <em>Who is trying to do it and for the benefit of whom?</em> <em>How do we know whether we are making progress and when we have succeeded?</em></p>

<pre>
* Old man yelling at cloud
* Mailing list and social media 'activism' - why is this worthwhile? why is this part of the contribution of LR
* Testing ideas
* keeping things in people consciousness
* how to influence the direction of scholarly communication in web science
* small visible results: uptake from conferences/workshops
</pre>

<p class="todo">
The real target of these messages is not you, me, or even the seniors,
professors, directors, conference organisers, programme committees, and
so on.

This is for the *next generation* of researchers and developers who are
following along or will hopefully read this up one day. They are the
ones who will be the change. We are only setting the stage for them to
follow through.

Of course I do hope that these ideas and the problems we are dealing
with resonate with more people. Hence, a plea for the "seniors" to
permit their "junior" colleagues to push forward. To grow their team
with a different set of ideals and awareness! Many already have for a
long time, and many are making that shift.

Neither do I actually expect these conferences/journals that have kept
their approach for so long to change overnight. As long as researchers
are constrained in how they communicate their knowledge, and how that
knowledge can be disseminated, no amount of activism here or elsewhere
will change that.

The purpose of these threads is purely about creating awareness and
building a mental infrastructure.

              <p class="todo">Why this will never happen: promotion and tenure are integral to the academic profession. The incentives in the academic profession predominantly relies on an ecosystem that is largely led by third-party publishers and services. The proposed work does not address or replace the reputation problem. The importance of Open Science is on the rise, from social media, to increase in <a href="https://osf.io/7jbnt/">academic jobs that mention</a></p>


<p id="role-of-institutions"><strong>Role of Institutions</strong>:
* what roles could libraries/institutions play? eg notify about article/review
* institutional repositories like eprints then they buy PURE from Springer.
* ldprints</p>

              <p>Potential solutions to these questions and new challenges need to address the connection and the gap between researchers, academic and public institutions, as well as what ends up in the commons. It is not just about researchers making their contributions available on the Web, or about conferences requesting semantically annotated contributions, or operating with transparent peer-review. All of these things must move in combination. Some of the kinds of actors in the ecosystem to address fulfilling the the LR principles can be along these lines:</p>

              <dl>
                <dt id="cooperating-researchers">Researchers</dt>
                <dd>Researchers take full responsibility of their contributions. This can be at any Webspace they put trust on or have sufficient authority over, eg. personal site, institutions’ student and faculty pages. Making their work as <q>Webby</q> as possible eg. linking their arguments and citations to others', interactive story-telling or experimentation possibilities for their readers to be learnable. Researchers can take special care to ensure URI persistence and archiving of their work.</dd>

                <dt id="cooperating-conferences-and-journals">Conferences and Journals</dt>
                <dd>In person conferences and online journals should encourage and accept research publications which use native Web standards and technologies. Support transparent and attributed peer-review process. Aggregation or proceedings of the events can be machine-friendly and archival measures should be taken in addition to those of researchers.</dd>

                <dt id="cooperating-public-institutions">Public Institutions</dt>
                <dd>Given sufficient evidence of the Web Science community’s acknowledgement of research as well as its contributions, eg. peer-reviews, academic institutions can officially acknowledge such work towards academic credit. Libraries can  make the community’s output discoverable, catalogued, enriched, among many other things.</dd>
              </dl>

              <p>Mention https://communitywiki.org/wiki/DoOcracy https://web.archive.org/web/20181231115548/https://communitywiki.org/wiki/DoOcracy ?</p>


              <p>This section is about how we realise/enable the social changes technically, whilst still adhering to the LR principles (ie. why we can't just use twitter/easychair for academia etc).</p>
              <p>Point at the social parts of the Control Yourself chapter (AP, AS2, LDN) and say how these fit into the ecosystem. How they mean we can do the things people need to do in scholarly communications in a way that meets the principles.</p>
              <p>This is where we bring the decentralisation stuff back home to in-practice scholarly comms.</p>

              <p>There are different approaches to 'fixing' the ecosystem. We could try a wholehearted replacement of the current system. That's unlikely to succeed. We could try to directly change existing players (like publishers, conferences) and demand that they do things differently. Also probably not gonna happen. It might be better to work *alongside* existing practices, and gradually ease scholars into new ways of operating. our goal is not necessarily to replicate major academic publishing houses or academic social networks..  smaller, personalised connected components might be both easier to realise and more effective in the long run. But.. who knows.</p>

          <p>The concepts and ideas discussed so far cover various aspects of the scholarly communication ecosystem, and in many cases ideas from different sources and different times overlap. I now take this related work, along with the context of the modern Web and the current state of scholarly communication, and use these to formulate the <cite><a href="https://linkedresearch.org/">Linked Research</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Research">LR</abbr>) initiative. This comprises foremost a set of principles intended to describe a researcher-centric information and interaction space optimised for scholarly communication on the Web. We will refer and reflect on these principles for the other contributions of this thesis.</p>

          <p>It quickly becomes clear that these principles build on existing ideas, but also in many cases are developed further and push for a future free from the constraints of academic publishing models tied to media from the past, as well as a strive to enable content creators to exercise their creativity to the fullest extent possible in order to affectively communicate.</p>

          <p>LR is also set up as a community effort, and here I present a snapshot of work which is expected to continue to develop as others contribute and more diverse voices bring their requirements to the table. For now, I acknowledge the bias towards Western (Euro and US centric) academic practices in the domain of Computer Science.</p>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Autonomy</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>The systems that are designed to fulfill the functions in scholarly communication should operate with the expectation of autonomous participation. One value that can be upheld through the principle of autonomy is to not have any constraints on where units of communication can exist on the Web. For instance, the actors of a system can have the freedom to designate identifiers to their artefacts: profile(s), articles, annotations, notifications, and so forth, as well as where they can be retrieved from. Similarly, the actor's autonomy to use preferred applications to interact with data. We consider that <em>decentralisation</em> of the information space is a means to gain autonomy on the Web. With respect to <em>delocalisation</em>, certain kinds of resources, eg. personal Web identifiers (WebID) controlled by their owners, can be used across different systems as they need not be tied to any particular URI space or system, and are free from external influences. Ultimately, autonomy is the right to freely choose and maintain sovereignty over URI ownership and data spaces, and the ability to use or switch between applications that can interact with them. Likewise, actors' autonomy would not obstruct them to use shared URI spaces if they so desire.</p>

                  <p>On the Web, any entity is entitled to associate a URI with a resource in accordance with <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#uri-ownership">URI ownership</a></cite>. It follows that any type of object, eg. scientific literature, research objects, personal websites, profiles and social graphs, can be made available on the Web provided that the <em>actors</em> have sufficient control over their URIs, or trust in others entities which do. While URI ownership is socially and technically within the reach of most academics, putting it into practice paves the way to a more decentralised and delocalised approach to using scholarly information spaces. Through URI ownership, decentralisation through deconstructing and decoupling can take place.</p>

                  <p>URI ownership is architecturally decentralised in that the location of a resource can physically exist anywhere in the world. However, architectural decentralisation is ultimately influenced by political or social centralisation at different levels. The <cite><a href="https://www.icann.org/">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a></cite> (<abbr title="Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers">ICANN</abbr>) coordinates the management of <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034">domain names</a></cite>, where top-level domains for like <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc920">countries, categories, multiorganization</a>, are then under the authority of specific organisations. Individuals then typically register fully qualified domain names (and map them to <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses) through accredited registries.</p>

                  <p>The contents of HTTP URLs may be logically centralised or decentralised. For example, the media representations found at the URL can embed compound or dynamic components that are dependent on external (remote) URLs. In this particular case, the persistence of the external URLs, as well as whether their contents are immutable is a design concern.</p>

                  <p>Autonomy is an important ingredient to fully exercise <em>freedom of expression</em>, which is a civil liberty. If a URI is governed by a third-party entity, ie. other than the researcher who shares the contents of a scientific resource, then it is possible that the URLs may no longer resolve, and the content may be subject to change in ways beyond researcher's control. Whereas without intermediaries, the researcher has sufficient access and control as to what happens at their URI space. A by-product of this ability is the notion of <em>self-registration</em> with respect to the registration function. Trust in this case is placed on the Web space that is closer to the "owners" of the URI and the publisher of the retrievable representations.</p>

                  <p>In this context, the notion of freedom of expression necessitates that the articulation of scholarly contributions are not subject to arbitrary interference from third-parties, and allow actors to seek the most appropriate ways to co-create and co-participate. We inherit:</p>

                  <blockquote cite="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">
                    <h5>Article 19.</h5>

                    <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</p>

                    <footer><cite><a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a></cite></footer>
                  </blockquote>

                  <p>Freedom of expression in context of scientific communication does not entail that any arbitrary artefact would qualif as a scientific literature without receiving some kind of a certification from the community. By free expression we mean that actors should not be subject to arbitrary constraints on how they communicate their discoveries and knowledge with the rest of the world. Enrolling in the certification process of some literature can for instance mean that reviewers may engage in any aspect and granularity of the contribution itself, eg. a weakness for an argument in one literature can be contrasted (and linked) with a scientific result presented in another literature.</p>

                  <p>The concerns about authenticity, persistence and permanence of data and knowledge is constant regardless of where the resources reside on the Web. Hence, strictly trusting scholarly knowledge based on its registered location is ultimately fragile in that it is unavoidable to prevent all sorts of threats to preservation in a long enough timeline. However, since the registration function is decoupled from archiving, we are able to delegate that trust to a "third-party" that is best fit to handle the preservation and to some extent guarantee the authenticity of the units of communication. This is particularly important if archival and trust is considered to be part of the global scholarly commons. As archival is an external function of scholarly communication, the notion of self-registration does not extend to archiving artefacts at a URI space that the actor controls, eg. authorised to modify artefacts.</p>

<!-- This is further explored in the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Evolution.html#ToII">Test of Independent Invention</a></cite> thought experiment. -->

                  <p>In context of the Web, technical or social decentralisation at all levels is unattainable. Even Web standards are a form of centralisation in that conforming systems can only coordinate among themselves. Similarly, centralisation naturally occurs in social systems like concepts or language, eg. machine-readable vocabularies restrict the set of uses of a system. The alternative pushed to the extreme where we each unit is expressed in their own language and without any language mapping, puts us in a situation similar to that of the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">Tower of Babel</a></cite>, ie. being incapable of understanding each other. Hence, autonomy in a system where researchers are isolated or information is not interpretable renders freedom of expression meaningless.</p>

                  <p>In context of publishing, we refer to the registration function that is irrespective of any certification or acknowledgement of the quality of work. Hence, when a researcher initiates registration, we refer to that as <q>self-registration</q>. The act of self-publishing eg. at one's own website, is effectively self-registration. Individuals can and should have autonomy over their own contributions without infringing on the autonomy of others.</p>

                  <p>Just as an object can have multiple global identifiers on the Web, autonomous registration in and itself does not interfere with multiple or other forms of registration across systems. For instance, a unit of communication can be simultaneously registered through systems with different capabilities and expectations that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. To name a few, autonomous URI spaces for personal or preferred, community managed persistence, institutional or organisational - typically due to publicly or privately-funded research.</p>

                  <p>While we aim for autonomous systems, we also seek interoperability and cooperation for actual communication take to place via universal access and interpretable information.</p>

                  <p>A globally democratic scientific and scholarly inquiry and progress fundamentally depends upon a well-informed citizenry. For societies to be well informed, the people must have ready access to information about the knowledge output of the scholarly community, the actions of the public officials based on available knowledge, and the development of public policies. The philosophical underpinnings of the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information">Freedom of Information</a></cite> (<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>) social movement trace back to the Age of Enlightenment (<span class="todo"></span>). Over the centuries, governments have incorporated constitutional, legal, and historical expressions of the people's right to public information (<span class="todo"></span>). A global freedom of information movement can be traced to the <cite>World Press Conference</cite> in 1893. The movement revolved around the need for unrestricted "access to news at its source and free transmission" of the news - - <cite>Freedom of Information Laws</cite>, p.53-54, urn:isbn:0123876729. A parallel movement in scholarly communication today is under the umbrella of <cite>Open Science</cite></p>

The W3C <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/International/">internationalization</a></cite> (<abbr title="Internationalization">i18n</abbr>) and <cite><a href="">localization</a></cite> (<abbr title="Localization">l10n</abbr>) initiatives and best practices helps towards this end. Internationalization refers to the design and development of mechanisms so that adaptable localization can take place in users' environment.</p>

                  <p id="internationalization">Internationalization of Web content and technologies is intended to make it possible for people to use them with different languages, scripts, and cultures. For example, content authors can:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>include links to navigate to different languages of the content;</li>
                    <li>declare the base language of a document, indicate multiple languages and their directional flow - to help with translations;</li>
                    <li>use Unicode character encoding, eg. UTF-8, in data forms and text to ensure correct effects;</li>
                    <li>check and minimise inappropriate cultural bias, and improve translatability;</li>
                    <li>restrict markup use to structure and semantics</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p id="localization">The localization of content would mean that user's preferred (or acceptable) visual design can be presented. For instance, human-readable numeric, date and time formats can be adapted to what we are familiar with; symbols, icons, and colours can be anywhere from what's culturally acceptable, familiar or comfortable for us to use; text and graphics can be normalised or transformed to minimise misinterpretation.</p>

                  <p>The <abbr title="Architecture of the World Wide Web">AWWW</abbr> states that agents, <em>interpret</em> available <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#dereference-details">representation according to the data format specification that corresponds to the representation's Internet Media Type.</q> Here we can use the term <em>interpretation</em> in the general sense for both human and machine consumers of representations. An interpretation entails that a given content can be identified or discovered; comprehended in context of where and how it is used; as well being to put it to further use. Scientific and scholarly knowledge representations using information models that are based on Web standards brought through open consensus benefit from wide reuse.</p>

                  <p id="interoperability"><strong>Interoperability</strong> is integral to achieving cooperative systems. One widely successful approach to have interoperable systems is through the adoption of open standards for protocols and languages that is achieved through industry consensus. As per Linked Data design principles, this is accomplished with HTTP for communication, URI for identification, and RDF as language. While a decentralised system can enable each entity to be autonomous, some level of agreement is needed on the network for communication to take place. Systems that are interoperable by design have the benefit of interacting with other systems without having prior and out-of-band knowledge about them. This kind of interoperability can be contrasted with <em>post-facto</em> interoperability that is typically due to propriety designs at the discretion of each party, and then bridging the systems with application adapters and semantic mappings. For example, given two systems, one system adopts the others' protocol, API, or format, or they build specialised mechanisms in order to communicate. Systems that do not use open standards or have specialised technological extensions that are only useful within their own environment are generally considered to be vendor lock-in solutions. Here we seek agreements on Web standards established through open consensus, as opposed to independent and individual design choices made in application implementations.</p>

                  <p>The Linked Data design principles - HTTP for interaction, URI to identify, and RDF as language - enables interoperable systems on the Web.</p>

                  <p>Systems vary on their degree of interoperability. For instance, a service may require their own user account or authentication mechanism to be used when interacting with data on the Web; users may have to use a particular application to access, create, share or reuse information; applications may need to be reconfigured to reuse the information that is created elsewhere. In the <a href="#acid-test">Acid Test</a> section we propose criteria to self-assess accessibility and interoperability of designs in scholarly communication.</p>

                  <p>As mentioned earlier, there is a natural balance between having free expression (through autonomy) and the degree of a communication (interoperability) among different parties to take place. At the same time, as centralisation of ideas is ultimately inescapable, interoperability influences or limits the choices a system can take. Hence, we embrace the notion of interoperability as a trade-off, ie. it is better to seek and adapt design patterns that are expected or intended to be better for the ecosystem as a whole than to adopt patterns that avoid this possibility. Hence, interoperability is a social structure acting against the autonomy of agents.</p>

                  <p>In order to have optimal means of discovery, exchanging, and reusing information, systems and data should opt for open standards and widely acknowledged best practices wherever possible. Linked Data technologies include some of the essentials to achieve this, and are well-suited to fulfil the four functions of scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

The foundation permits <a href="http://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html">registration agencies</a> to manage DOI records. In order to have a resource assigned with a DOI, it has to be done through one of the DOI registration agencies. Given the statement in AWWW, <q><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-persistence">URI persistence is a matter of policy and commitment on the part of the URI owner</a></q>, DOI introduces an additional layer of social contract to govern the discovery of scientific artefacts. A DOI is aimed at being a persistent identifier for an object it is assigned to, and has the mechanism to refer to the URL of an object where it can be found. That is, a DOI may refer to a landing page about the actual object and not necessarily the object itself; the latter happens to be a common practice in the scholarly information space. For literature that has restricted access, the resolved DOI is typically a webpage where an actor would need to go through the system's <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> in order to retrieve the content. For open literature, the resolved DOI would generally hyperlink to the actual scientific object in human-interpretable only fashion, or be part of a webpage accompanied by material unrelated to the scientific object itself, ie. information that the scientists neither assembled as part of their research nor intended for the consumer. If the actual URL of the object changes, the DOI's lookup table for the URL has to be updated. Otherwise, they'll point to dead links or unrelated information.</p>

              <p id="orcid"><cite><a href="https://orcid.org/">Open Researcher and Contributor ID</a></cite> (<abbr title="Open Researcher and Contributor ID">ORCID</abbr>) is a persistent identifier for scientists, academic authors and contributors. An ORCID ID is specified as an URI. While anyone can create and update their ORCID profile, the identifier is ultimately owned and managed by the ORCID organisation and made available through <code>orcid.org</code>. While where each researcher has their online profiles is at their discretion, it has a natural constraint on what their profile can ultimately express. For most intents and purpose, the free service offered by ORCID is sufficient for most researchers, it has provides a mechanism where researchers can extend their profile descriptions by linking to their other online profiles. One unintended consequence of this popular centralisation in scholarly communication is that a growing number of institutions and publishers require researchers to participate with their ORCID IDs, as opposed to any URI on the Web. The resulting effects of <a href="https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter">such initiatives</a> are counter to LR design principles. At the same time, the administration of the URI by the ORCID organisation removes the burden of maintaining the URI as well as the profile URL. In this case, a "trusted" third-party takes care of the identifier, where as the researcher takes cares of the content made available at the URL.</p>

              <p>The Web is the <strong>medium</strong> in which <cite>Linked Research</cite> is a <strong>message</strong> within.</p>

              <p class="todo">Move some of this to framing/background</p>

              <p>The Web is capable of offering rich interactions for humans and machines. While scientists have adopted the Web as an ideal medium to exchange knowledge, I posit that it is not being used efficiently or optimally due to both social and technical reasons. What we can ask is if it is possible to use the medium to its full potential, and observe the <em>effects</em>. We can also consider the consequences of pushing this to the extreme - as per McLuhan's <em>reverses into</em>. Hence we should strive to understand the ways we are self-amputating in the pursuit of acquiring knowledge about the fabric of reality. LR is not only a set of design principles to shape the technical scholarly communication ecosystem, but an initiative to strive to experience the full effects of the Web by adopting what it has to offer. In part, LR is an attempt to actively break away from practices which enhance isolationism or still fundamentally work within the print-centric paradigm. Technologies that enable or enhance the social dimensions on the Web for example makes involvement with content possible. The design principles are a nudge towards this goal.</p>

              <p>LR is also a conceptual framework that describes how implementations in scholarly communication can interoperate. Its philosophy is influenced by the social machinery to build a knowledge Web for humans and machines as part of a cooperating system. Knowledge tends to get lost if it can't be retrieved, hence it has limited value. Thus, a holistic approach to universal access for all agents is an important criteria.</p>

              <p>Is LR a yet another model? Not exactly. Its design is in agreement with certain qualities of the existing works and practices in the wild. However, LR looks at the problem space by revisiting the characteristics of the medium, and what the actors can achieve in context of scientific communication. Arbitrary or artificial barriers are anti-patterns.</p>

              <p>Are there ideological and technology traps? The traps can be seen as analogous to McLuhan's <q>reverses into</q> effect. When the LR design principles are pushed to the extreme, highly specialised and fine-grained centralised systems can and will emerge while still operating within the larger decentralised system on the Web. The degree of federation or interoperability among the autonomous systems will vary. The effects may be that of a new generation of third-party control and authority over certain information spaces. For example, just as centralised publishing and distribution services currently exist for the dominating paper-centric industry, the medium can still accommodate similar control over semantic and granular scientific resources. It is worthwhile to note that the ecosystem would only become more diverse as it expands. Entropy is an inherent property of the Web.</p>

              <p>It is worthwhile to note here that the earlier or existing models for information exchange that has been described so far primarily focus on institutional or subject repository driven scholarly communication. They are contrasted against the involvement of third-party (for-profit) service providers which impose a particular arrangement of the coupling of the scholarly information space per <em>forces and functions</em>. In the remainder of this thesis, I focus on enabling a <strong>researcher-centric</strong> model; whilst this can be situated within the same <q>deconstructing</q> or <q>decoupling</q> school of thought, its pursuit is embracing greater control by content creators through the native characteristics of the Web, without interfering with the certification function regardless of the academic discipline; humanities, social, natural, formal, or applied sciences. The notion of content creators or consumers having some control on accessibility, registration and archiving, inherits certain qualities of coupling. That is, researcher-centric coupling unleashes the potentials of expressivity and effective scholarly communication.</p>

              <p>While the criteria for publishing provided by <cite>Genuine Semantic Publishing</cite> is valuable and can also be exercised by following LR's <q>interpretable</q> design principle, we do not prescribe it in order to not conflict with the <q>freedom of expression</q> principle. If a third-party imposes a specific way to express knowledge, whether it is through file formats and their structure and semantics; what (meta)data to include or not include; or inclusion and use of interactive components; the quality of the communication is subject to be less effective because the author may have to make compromises. Information loss occurs and communication quality naturally degrades simply because what the actors wish to convey in their message, and how, will have to be filtered down in order to fit the requirements of a third-party, data formats, or user interfaces.</p>

              <p>At the time of this writing, LR's principles and the strive for interoperable systems is conceived within the Web paradigm, as opposed to the broader Internet. There are emerging technologies and platforms within the Internet which are highly specialised for security, versioning, distributed, and so forth, which give way to new possibilities on how the scholarly communication market can be realised. While this thesis fits LR's principles into particular contemporary technology stacks, this is for practical purposes and to demonstrate what can be achieved today. Nothing prevents the principles from being adopted under different environments. It is quite likely that the design philosophies of the new environments will differ.</p>

              <p class="todo">What is the scope? What are some of the instabilities or inadequate use of the system? What is missing or could use more development/attentions?</p>

              <p class="todo">We all produce and distribute information. It is our part of our nature. What kinds of rules would serve everyone's (writers and readers) needs in the Web environment? What may be the constrains?</p>

              <p class="todo">Use Kuhn's "accuracy consistency scope simplicity fruitfulness" to explain the quality of the LR paradigm,</p>



              <p>Sooner or later we need a strategy to address questions like: <em>What do we aim to accomplish?</em> <em>Who is trying to do it and for the benefit of whom?</em> <em>How do we know whether we are making progress and when we have succeeded?</em></p>

              <p>Potential solutions to these questions and new challenges need to address the connection and the gap between researchers, academic and public institutions, as well as what ends up in the commons. It is not just about researchers making their contributions available on the Web, or about conferences requesting semantically annotated contributions, or operating with transparent peer-review. All of these things must move in combination. Some of the kinds of actors in the ecosystem to address fulfilling the the LR principles can be along these lines:</p>

              <dl>
                <dt id="cooperating-researchers">Researchers</dt>
                <dd>Researchers take full responsibility of their contributions. This can be at any Webspace they put trust on or have sufficient authority over, eg. personal site, institutions’ student and faculty pages. Making their work as <q>Webby</q> as possible eg. linking their arguments and citations to others', interactive story-telling or experimentation possibilities for their readers to be learnable. Researchers can take special care to ensure URI persistence and archiving of their work.</dd>

                <dt id="cooperating-conferences-and-journals">Conferences and Journals</dt>
                <dd>In person conferences and online journals should encourage and accept research publications which use native Web standards and technologies. Support transparent and attributed peer-review process. Aggregation or proceedings of the events can be machine-friendly and archival measures should be taken in addition to those of researchers.</dd>

                <dt id="cooperating-public-institutions">Public Institutions</dt>
                <dd>Given sufficient evidence of the Web Science community’s acknowledgement of research as well as its contributions, eg. peer-reviews, academic institutions can officially acknowledge such work towards academic credit. Libraries can  make the community’s output discoverable, catalogued, enriched, among many other things.</dd>

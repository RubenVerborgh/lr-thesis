                <h3 property="schema:name">Autonomy</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>Today it would be difficult think of a Web without social functions. Perhaps the Web's support and ability to facilitate social interactions - above anything else - contributed to the transformation of societies in the last quarter century. The Web, as a medium, expedited all patterns of social interrelationships in a manner that can be more efficiently documented, discovered and reused. It necessitates that the system design should be inclusive and facilitate involvement within the range of an actor's autonomy. Furthermore, actors being able to use socially-aware decentralised applications that can perform the core functions in scholarly communications - registration, awareness, certification, and archiving.</p>

                  <p>The systems that are designed to fulfill the functions in scholarly communication should operate with the expectation of autonomous participation. One value that can be upheld through the principle of autonomy is to not have any constraints on where units of communication can exist on the Web. For instance, the actors of a system can have the freedom to designate identifiers to their artefacts: profile(s), articles, annotations, notifications, and so forth, as well as where they can be retrieved from. Similarly, the actor's autonomy to use preferred applications to interact with data. It can be considered that <em>decentralisation</em> of the information space is <em>a</em> means to gain autonomy on the Web. With respect to <em>delocalisation</em>, certain kinds of resources, eg. personal Web identifiers (WebID) controlled by their owners, can be used across different systems as they need not be tied to any particular URI space or system, and are free from external influences. Ultimately, autonomy is the right to freely choose and maintain sovereignty over URI ownership and data spaces, and the ability to use or switch between applications that can interact with them. Likewise, actors' autonomy would not obstruct them to use shared URI spaces if they so desire.</p>

                  <p>Any type of object, eg. scientific literature, research objects, personal websites, profiles and social graphs, can be made available on the Web provided that the <em>actors</em> have sufficient control over their URIs, or delegate to entities they trust. While URI ownership is socially and technically within the reach of most academics, putting it into practice paves the way to a more decentralised and delocalised approach to using scholarly information spaces. Through URI ownership, decentralisation through deconstructing and decoupling can take place.</p>

                  <p>The contents of HTTP URLs may be logically centralised or decentralised. For example, the media representations found at the URL can embed compound or dynamic components that are dependent on external (remote) URLs. In this particular case, the persistence of the external URLs, as well as whether their contents are immutable is a design concern.</p>

                  <p>Autonomy is an important ingredient to fully exercise <em>freedom of expression</em>, which is a civil liberty. If a URI is governed by a third-party entity, ie. other than the researcher who shares the contents of a scientific resource, then it is possible that the URLs may no longer resolve, and the content may be subject to change in ways beyond researcher's control. Whereas without intermediaries, the researcher has sufficient access and control as to what happens at their URI space. This gives actors the ability to exercise <em>self-registration</em> with respect to the registration function. Trust in this case is placed on the Web space that is closer to the "owners" of the URI and the publisher of the retrievable representations.</p>

                  <p>The right to have <em>freedom of expression</em> necessitates that the articulation of scholarly contributions are not subject to arbitrary interference from third-parties, and allow actors to seek the most appropriate ways to co-create and co-participate. We inherit:</p>

                  <blockquote cite="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">
                    <h5>Article 19.</h5>

                    <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</p>

                  </blockquote>

                  <p id="freedom-of-expression-constraints">Freedom of expression in context of academic communication does not entail that any arbitrary artefact eg. self-published articles, passes quality-control and certification from the community, or ethically appropriate. By free expression, I mean that actors should not be subject to <em>technical constraints</em> on how they communicate their discoveries and knowledge with the rest of the world. That is, to have the means to <em>shape</em> machine-readable structure and semantics, presentation, and interactions. Enrolling in the certification process of some literature can for instance mean that reviewers may engage in any aspect and granularity of the contribution itself, eg. a weakness for an argument in one literature can be contrasted (and linked) with a scientific result presented in another literature. Academic freedom to express entails that researchers caring out their work comply with discipline-specific methods and meet standards related to accuracy, precision, completeness, reliability, relevance, and so forth. Furthermore, as with human rights, the ability to express does not grant unethical practices at the expense of any person or group, nor should be tolerated. Similarly, technical expressions that are harmful or discriminatory, eg. inaccessible content, constrained presentations, or undesirable user interactions, should be avoided.</p>

                  <p>The concerns about authenticity, persistence and permanence of data and knowledge is constant regardless of where the resources reside on the Web. Hence, strictly trusting scholarly knowledge based on its registered location is ultimately fragile in that it is unavoidable to prevent all sorts of threats to preservation in a long enough timeline. However, since the registration function is decoupled from archiving, we are able to delegate that trust to a third-party that is best fit to handle the preservation and to some extent guarantee the authenticity of the units of communication. This is particularly important as archival and trust are part of the global scholarly commons.</p>

                  <p>In context of the Web, technical or social decentralisation at all levels is unattainable. Even open Web standards are based on social and technical decisions, and can be seen as a form of centralisation in that conforming systems cluster and coordinate among themselves. Similarly, centralisation naturally occurs in social systems like concepts or language, eg. machine-readable vocabularies restrict the set of uses of a system. The alternative pushed to the extreme where each unit is expressed in their own language and without any language mapping, puts us in a situation similar to that of the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel">Tower of Babel</a></cite>, ie. being incapable of understanding each other. Hence, autonomy in a system where researchers are isolated or information is not interpretable renders freedom of expression meaningless.</p>

                  <p>A globally democratic scientific and scholarly inquiry and progress fundamentally depends upon a well-informed citizenry. For societies to be well informed, the people must have ready access to information about the knowledge output of the scholarly community, the actions of the public officials based on available knowledge, and the development of public policies. The philosophical underpinnings of the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information">Freedom of Information</a></cite> (<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>) social movement trace back to the Age of Enlightenment. Over the centuries, governments have incorporated constitutional, legal, and historical expressions of the people's right to public information. A global freedom of information movement can be traced to the <cite>World Press Conference</cite> in 1893. The movement revolved around the need for unrestricted "access to news at its source and free transmission" of the news - <cite>Freedom of Information Laws</cite>, p.53-54, urn:isbn:0123876729. A parallel movement in scholarly communication today is under the umbrella of <cite><a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#open-science">Open Science</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p><em>Universal access</em> to information can be attributed to two distinct but related areas:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>freedom to inquire; the right and means to access information</li>

                  <p id="free-culture"><strong>Free Culture</strong>: In order to disseminate scientific information on the Web with minimal friction, usage rights and responsibilities should permit anyone to share, reuse, and remix information under various conditions.

                  <p>The <abbr title="Architecture of the World Wide Web">AWWW</abbr> states that agents, <em>interpret</em> available <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#dereference-details">representation according to the data format specification that corresponds to the representation's Internet Media Type.</q> Here we can use the term <em>interpretation</em> in the general sense for both human and machine consumers of representations. An interpretation entails that a given content can be identified or discovered; comprehended in context of where and how it is used; as well being to put it to further use. Scientific and scholarly knowledge representations using information models that are based on Web standards brought through open consensus benefit from wide reuse.</p>

                  <p id="interoperability"><strong>Interoperability</strong>: is integral to achieving cooperative systems. One widely successful approach to have interoperable systems is through the adoption of open standards for protocols and languages that is achieved through consensus. As per Linked Data design principles, this is accomplished with HTTP for communication, URI for identification, and RDF as language. While a decentralised system can enable each entity to be autonomous, some level of agreement is needed on the network for communication to take place. Systems that are interoperable by design have the benefit of interacting with other systems without having prior and out-of-band knowledge about them. This kind of interoperability can be contrasted with <em>post-facto</em> interoperability that is typically due to propriety designs at the discretion of each party, and then bridging the systems with application adapters and semantic mappings. For example, given two systems, one system adopts the others' protocol, API, or format, or they build specialised mechanisms in order to communicate. Systems that do not use open standards or have specialised technological extensions that are only useful within their own environment are generally considered to be vendor lock-in solutions. Here we seek agreements on Web standards established through open consensus, as opposed to independent and individual design choices made in application implementations.</p>

                  <p>Systems vary on their degree of interoperability. For instance, a service may require their own user account or authentication mechanism to be used when interacting with data on the Web; users may have to use a particular application to access, create, share or reuse information; applications may need to be reconfigured to reuse the information that is created elsewhere. In the <a href="#acid-test">Acid Test</a> section I propose criteria to self-assess accessibility and interoperability of artefacts in scholarly communication.</p>

                  <p>There is a natural balance between having free expression of structure and semantics (through autonomy) and the degree of a communication (interoperability) among different parties to take place. At the same time, as centralisation of ideas is ultimately inescapable, interoperability influences or limits the choices a system can take. Hence, we embrace the notion of interoperability as a trade-off, ie. it is better to seek and adapt design patterns that are expected or intended to be better for the ecosystem as a whole than to adopt patterns that avoid this possibility. Hence, interoperability is a social construct with the intention of balancing autonomy and cooperative systems.</p>

                  <p>In order to have optimal means of discovery, exchanging, and reusing information, systems and data should opt for open standards and widely acknowledged best practices wherever possible. Linked Data technologies include some of the essentials to achieve this, and are well-suited to fulfil the four functions of scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                  <p>Thus we refer to <q>universal access</q> in the widest sense that any agent; human, machine, or other can effectively access information and participate.</p>

                  <p>The <cite><a href="https://linkresearch.org/cloud">Linked Open Research Cloud</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Open Research Cloud">LORC</abbr>) project aims to increase the awareness, discovery, and reuse of resources about scholarly communication on the Web in the form of publicly accessible Linked Data. It is intended to fulfill the <em>awareness</em> function of scientific communication.</p>

                  <p>It pursues this by accepting notifications <em>about</em> scholarly activities, making them available for reuse, and generates an interactive visualisation for additional exploration. Consequently, LORC can assist researchers with their applications to discover pertinent scholarly information on the Web, and connect their knowledge with the global knowledge graph. For the wider scientific community, LORC can facilitate scientometrics studies and decision making based on the scholarly commons ecosystem.</p>

                  <p>To this end, LORC, as a unit of communication, advertises its <em>inbox</em> to receive <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> about scholarly activities, eg. publication of scholarly articles, <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">Web Annotations</a></cite> (eg. assessments, replies), citations, call for contributions, proceedings, scientific observations and workflows, arguments, funding, decisions, and so forth. The notifications are licensed with <cite><a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p>The notifications serve as (pre-)registrations of research and scholarly activities, hence play a role in fulfilling the certification function. The inbox and the notifications are archivable.</p>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Linked Specifications, Test Suites, and Implementation Reports</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>To demonstrate the extensibility of units of communication within the frame of Linked Research, I extend the LDN <a href="linked-data-notifications#test-suite-and-implementation-reports">test suite and implementation reports</a> and <a href="linked-data-notifications#linked-data-notifications-implementations">implementations</a> and describe the development of an interlinked, human and machine-readable W3C Recommendation, its test suite, and implementation reports as a whole.</p>

                  <p>The missing connection among existing specifications and test reports is that a uniform resource discovery is not possible between the test reports and the individual conformance criteria in the specifications, where a given information at a particular URL is both human and machine-processable (see <cite><a href="http://csarven.ca/linked-specifications-reports#related-work">related work</a></cite>.)</p>

                  <p>Having the specifications and implementation reports interlinked and retrievable can facilitate their automated discovery and reuse. One use case is to be able to find applications that match a certain conformance criteria, eg. in order to have fine-grained bundling of software packages. While this would typically include "normative requirements", tests can potentially capture and reveal optional features of specifications. Prospective consumers of the compliance reports can be application developers finding appropriate software for use, as well as automatic software package managers.</p>

                  <p>The following <a href="#figure-linked-specifications-reports">figure</a> depicts an overview of linking the LDN specification, its test suite, the generated implementation report for the dokieli project, reports summary, and an article citing the specification.</p>

                  <p>The information patterns in the LDN <a href="#specification">specification</a> and the <a href="linked-data-notifications#test-suite-and-implementation-reports">implementation reports</a> sections are reusable across other specifications and related components. Sources are available from:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>The specification: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/</a></li>
                    <li>The test suite: <a href="https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/">https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/</a></li>
                    <li>Implementation reports summary and individual reports: <a href="https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary">https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary</a></li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>The test suite uses the <cite><a href="https://github.com/csarven/mayktso">mayktso</a></cite> server as the LDN receiver, but any conformant receiver implementation will work here.</p>

                  <p>The notifications carrying the reports have an HTML+RDFa representation (alternatively in other RDF serialisations upon content negotiation). The scholarly article on <cite><a href="http://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications" rel="cito:citesAsEvidence">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> uses the <cite><a href="http://purl.org/spar/cito/">CiTO</a></cite> vocabulary to cite the specification with <code>cito:citesAsAuthority</code>. Another peer reviewed article, <cite><a href="http://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww" rel="cito:citesAsEvidence">Decentralised Authoring, Annotations and Notifications for a Read-Write Web with dokieli</a></cite>, contextually cites the specification with <code>cito:citesAsPotentialSolution</code> from its <a href="http://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww#architectural-overview" rel="cito:citesAsEvidence">architectural overview</a> section, as well as the LDN Test Suite with <code>cito:citesAsAuthority</code> from its <a href="http://csarven.ca/dokieli-rww#adoption" rel="cito:citesAsEvidence">adoption</a> section. This is useful in that we can have articles linked to what is already available with minimal effort. Including this article that you are currently reading and interacting with.</p>

                  <p>The realisation here is that we have everything operating in a way that is interoperable: the specification, test suite, discovery of the reports, and academic articles, all reusing existing vocabularies.</p>

              <p>There is an abundance of scientific information on the Web. However, humans and machines have restricted access, are required to pay, or hindered to efficiently discover relations. The knowledge industry can better address societal challenges by embracing the virtues of the Web via decentralisation and interconnectivity of our collective knowledge.</p>

              <p id="mirroring-the-web"><strong>Mirroring the Web</strong>: LR is an initiative to strive to experience the full effects of the Web by observing and making use of its affordances. LR serves as a conceptual framework that describes how actors can control their interactions and data, make use of human and machine-readable information through Web-interfaces, as well as how decentralised and socially-aware applications can exchange information on route to fulfilling the core functions of scholarly communication.</p>

              <p id="traps"><strong>Traps</strong>: Are there ideological and technology "traps" in LR? The traps can be seen as analogous to McLuhan's <a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#effect-reverses-into">reverses into</a> effect. When the LR design principles are "pushed to the extreme", highly specialised and fine-grained centralised systems may emerge while still operating within the larger decentralised system on the Web. The degree of federation or interoperability among the autonomous systems will vary. The artefacts may be that of a new generation of third-party control and authority over certain information spaces. For example, just as centralised publishing and distribution services currently exist for the dominating print-centric industry, the medium can still accommodate similar control over semantic and granular scientific resources. Individual autonomy without cooperation among the actors can make it difficult to maintain trust.</p>

              <p id="reconfiguring-forces-and-functions"><strong>Reconfiguring Forces and Functions</strong>: The existing or prior models for information exchange that has been described so far primarily focus on institutional or subject repository driven scholarly communication. They are contrasted against the involvement of third-party service providers - for- or non-profit - which impose a particular arrangement of the coupling of the scholarly information space per <em>forces and functions</em>. For instance, traditional journals most commonly couple the registration and certification functions, whereas the configuration based on LR allows different actors to activate different functions.</p>

              <p id="basic-costs"><strong>Basic Costs</strong>: From the perspective of an actor, the costs for a personal domain name along with data storage can be in the range of 100 USD per year with sufficient space for common Web publishing - "unlimited" amount of registration of units of communication and publishing any hypermedia. As for archiving services, it would be typically handled by "external" stakeholders with respect to the actor sharing their registered content.</p>

              <p id="social-barriers"><strong>Social Barriers</strong>: At this time, promotion and tenure are integral to the academic profession. The incentives in the academic profession predominantly relies on an ecosystem that is largely led by third-party publishers and services.</p>

              <p>I will use Kuhn's five characteristics - <a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#objectivity-value-judgment-and-theory-choice">accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness</a> - to measure the quality of <cite>Linked Research</cite> as a shared paradigm for scholarly communication on the Web. The criteria is not intended to be exhaustive but, rather, used to cover varied aspects to situate LR. I provide these descriptions for the purpose of assisting <a href="#stakeholders">stakeholders</a> gain a perspective on LR's values, facilitate determining its adequacy for use, as well as to evaluate LR against other models.</p>

              <p>LR is based on the notion that the Web is inherently decentralised, social, and for everyone. Its design principles shapes data and systems to be built on open Web standards.</p>

              <p id="paradigm-accuracy"><strong>Accuracy</strong>: LR is based on the core mechanisms for identification, interaction, and representation of units of information on the Web. For instance, <cite><a href="#semantic-citations">semantic citations</a></cite> enables actors to build precise and contextual relations between atomic units, preserve author's intentions at the time of citing, create a snapshot of the target while citing, as well as announce the citation activity. Thus, the creation, dissemination, and discovery of typed citations (as opposed to generic citations), brings forth an accurate representation of a network of shared knowledge. In this respect, LR is empirically adequate within the frame of what Linked Data vocabularies can potentially express irrespective of where the cited entities are located on the Web.</p>

              <p id="paradigm-consistency"><strong>Consistency</strong>: LR is consistent within itself as per the alignment with the architecture of the Web and using open Web standards (in contrast to print-centric approaches on the Web). LR adopts the notion of actors having free and unrestricted access to knowledge, and thus consistent with many community principles and initiatives with the same goal eg. the Open Access movement, self-archiving of literature so that it is readable by anyone for free. With respect to the common social practices around publishing, LR differs from the alternative approaches in that actors ultimately decide how to make their contributions. Hence, LR is inconsistent with the existing practice or market-driven notion of requiring actors to use particular third-party services in order to participate in scientific and knowledge exchange, as well as the way in which contributions are acknowledged by relevant stakeholders. Furthermore, LR is currently a technology driven change as opposed to market driven change in that the added value comes from a way to reconfigure the interplay of forces and functions. However, it is not a paradigmatic change in terms of strategic repositioning and development of the forces and functions eg. who can ultimately be an actor and their potential competences.</p>

              <p id="paradigm-scope"><strong>Scope</strong>: LR has broad scope in that knowledge can be incrementally connected and extended (at any time) by using shared identifiers for units of communication and compatible data models. Through the use of languages like RDF, information discovery mechanism remains uniform.</p>

              <p id="paradigm-simplicity"><strong>Simplicity</strong>: LR is a "lossless" approach to representing and sharing information on the Web in that the content can be registered independently from its presentation and behaviour, thus making it possible to refer and connect units of communication at any level of abstraction. As machine-readable representation is encoded through the serialisation of the RDF language, the underlying information can be transformed into alternative serialisations without compromising its integrity. The Open Web Platform makes it possible to treat and handle content "as is" without requiring supplemental protocols, proprietary plug-ins, or external tools to create and share content.</p>

              <p id="paradigm-fruitfulness"><strong>Fruitfulness</strong>: Machine-readable information facilitates discovery and reuse of units of communication. As in the case of semantic citations, LR opens up the possibility to create as well as detect precise relations which were previously unnoted or disclosed through appropriate interoperable standards. Units of communication in the form of a knowledge graph being machine-identifiable and queryable has the affordance to detect or inspect patterns. For instance, open research questions can be found by analysing semantically structured literature, as well as detecting topical trends in research communities. LR's design principles enables the use of existing and future open Web standards. Its continuous interoperability would permit LR to be evolvable.</p>

              <p>Whether to use the LR model will depend on the "value judgment" of stakeholders and research community. LR is merely a reflection of using the Web to its full potential for scholarly communication.</p>

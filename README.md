# Linked Research Thesis
This is a placeholder repository for my PhD thesis. I'm told that I have to chisel a document into stone to fulfill some arbitrary needs of an institution in order to be qualified to speak and manipulate societies.

## Table of Contents
* Abstract
* Acknowledgements

### Introduction
* Paradigm Shifts
* Open Access-Science-Knowledge
* Decentralisation
* (http://csarven.ca/cooling-down-web-science)[Cooling Down Web Science]
* Problem Statement
  * Technical challenges
  * Social challenges
  * The challenges due to sum of those
* Research Questions
  * How can we tear down these barriers? Data structures/models.. Web standards
  * Operative level: workflows, processes.. improving suitable communication interfaces
  * How well can people in the scientific community (progressive/conservation/or even backwards) get their job done.. How usable is it?
* Contributions
  * Towards enabling accessible knowledge in the LOD cloud - filling the giant gap
  * Linked Research
  * dokieli
  * CEUR
  * SemStats
  * Decentralised Notifications
  * Shift in Web Science community. How well are these ideas spread?

### Concept and Approach
* (http://csarven.ca/linked-research-scholarly-communication#requirements)Requirements]
* (http://csarven.ca/linked-research-scholarly-communication#concepts)[Concepts]
* (http://csarven.ca/linked-research-scholarly-communication#user-stories)[User Stories]
* Existing work/systems and their coverage
* The evidence that these challenges are "challenges" and their interplay
* Scope of this thesis

### Scholarly Semantics
* Structures of knowledge (interlinks between [high-level] entities, data models, information granularity, vocabularies)
* History of Scholarly HTML
* Why RDF. Suitability of RDF (in prose). Scope and motivations for RDFa over alternatives.
* RDFa editors (what can/do they produce)
* URIs for prose, concepts, ideas, research sections as deemed important by authors.
* Implementation of embedding prose semantics with dokieli (evaluation).
* Web technologies for authoring, self-publishing; progressive enhancement, alternative presentations, exposing data along with "papers"
* Citations (pulling and reusing external data)
* Embedding data (top-down / bottom-up)
* Embedding statistical and experimental data, and views
* Multimodal active documents
* LD/SW enables decentralisation, which leads us to...

### Decentralised Active Documents and "Control Yourself"
* Culture of academic gatekeepers vs self-publishing / bloggers.
* Related work on academia and social media (which is increasingly coming up in multiple disciplines).
* 'Open' publishing silos like academia.edu/researchgate etc and their scope/motivation. How can a transition be made (to dokieli) or an interface between them.
* Decentralisation and data ownership in other contexts, and how this can be leveraged in academia.
* Implementation in dokieli / LDP/Solid (eg Save/Save As/New, ACL)
* Decentralised Inbox and Notifications

### Social Web
* Motivations about peer-review being a contribution to the world and acknowledging it.
* Existing silo'd systems for annotations/comments
* What do we need to do to make the same functionality available in a decentralised way?
* Persistence and permanance
* Standards: OA, AS, PROV-O, Solid.
* Licensing
* Inbox / Notifications
* How this could feed into the scholarly process for journals/proceedings etc.
* Web Annotations
  * Replies
  * Peer-Reviews (+/1, specificity) and motivations to contribute to the world and acknowledgement
  * Notes
* Interactions
  * Sharing (public or private addressbook)
  * Bookmarking (tagging)
  * Reactions: (dis)approvals
* Addressing social implications of decentralised annotations and UX

### Evaluation/Study
* Experiment on document credibility/citability
* User experiment with different tasks (for the purpose of showing that dokieli or parts of it is a contribution). How well do they understand or to what extent are they capable of using e.g., the vocabularies.. in authoring.
* Interviews?
* How hard/easy is it to adopt LR model or be interopable with other systems.

### Conclusions and Future Work
* Difficult challenges: Persistence/Permanence
* Overview of dokieli implementation for complete scholarly pipeline (and what's still to be done).
* What impact have this work made to the community?
* Look at all these people using dokieli in the wild!
* And all these conferences/workshops in Web Science/Semantic Web that now accept HTML (and friends)! Give context (what happened since first engaging the community about "Linked Research" ideas)
* Cool big graph visualisations of papers and data and CEUR proceedings and call for contributions (SemStats)
* Limitations of this work and areas that can be developed further
* Related efforts that were started during the course of this thesis and to what extent they compare and how they are captured with the LR principles.
* What we learned

## Brainstorm thesis titles
* Scholarly Communications and the Semantic Web (too broad; more like a subject classifications)
* Enabling Decentralised Accessible Knowledge Through Linked Research (good, but only reflects the static part of the work)
* Linked Research as Decentralised Scholarly Communication (broadest title in terms of workflow support.. doesn't say anything about knowledge model)
* Linked Research as an application of hypermedia for scholarly communication (possibly best, traditinal terminology in CS - still a bit highlevel)

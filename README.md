# Linked Research Thesis
This is a placeholder repository for my PhD thesis. I'm told that I have to chisel a document into stone to fulfill some arbitrary needs of an institution in order to be qualified to speak and manipulate societies.

FIXME: Make the ToC/Chapter headings sound "cooler"

## Outline
0. Abstract
1. Introduction
2. Background
3. Related Work
4. Concept and Approach
5. Realisation
6. Authoring and Annotations
* Inbox / Notifications
* Vocabularies
7. Linking Data and Publications
  * Statistics
  * Citations
8. Evaluation
  * Experiment on document credibility/citability
  * User experiment with different tasks (for the purpose of showing that dokieli or parts of it is a contribution)
9. Comparability of research articles and contributions
10. Conclusions and Future Work


## Possible titles:
* Scholarly Communications and the Semantic Web
* Enabling Accessible Knowledge


## TOC ideas:

### Introduction
* Overview of perceived problems in scholarly publishing and the research pipeline. Open Access/Science
* Why pursue this challenge: technical and social. Past and Current initiatives.
* What do native Web technologies and existing standards provide?
* Which parts of Semantic Web technologies could help and definitions of stuff if necessary.
* The Linked Research 'manifesto'.

### Scholarly Semantics
* History of Scholarly (HTML)
* Why RDF. Suitability of RDF (in prose). Scope and motivations for RDFa over alternatives.
* RDFa editors and how they need to be better
* URIs for prose, concepts, ideas, research sections as deemed important by authors.
* Implementation of embedding prose semantics with dokieli (evaluation).
* Embedding statistical and experimental data (related work/existing tools and standards).
* Implementation of stats stuff (evaluation).
* SW enables decentralisation, which leads us to...

### Control Yourself
* Culture of academic gatekeepers vs self-publishing / bloggers.
* Related work on academia and social media (which is increasingly coming up in multiple disciplines).
* 'Open' publishing silos like academia.edu/researchgate etc and their scope/motivation. Lessons learnt?
* Decentralisation and data ownership in other contexts, and how this can be leveraged in academia.
* Implementation in dokieli / LDP/Solid
* Web technologies for self-publishing; progressive enhancement, alternative presentations, exposing data along with papers.
* oh and since we're decentralised we need to do something about peer-review....

### Feedback, interactions and peer-review
* Motivations about peer-review being a contribution to the world and acknowledging it.
* Also limitations and problems etc like what Max said.
* Existing silo'd systems for annotations/comments
* What do we need to do to make the same functionality available in a decentralised way?
* Persistence and permanance
* Standards: OA, AS, PROV-O, Solid.
* Licensing
* Inbox / Notifications
* Implementation!!!
* How this could feed into the scholarly process for journals/proceedings etc.

### Conclusion
* Overview of dokieli implementation for complete scholarly pipeline (and what's still to be done).
* Look at all these people using dokieli in the wild!
* And all these conferences/workshops in Web Science/Semantic Web that now accept HTML (and friends)! Give context (what happened since first engaging the community about "Linked Research" ideas)
* Cool big graph visualisations of papers and data and CEUR proceedings and call for contributions (SemStats)
* Related efforts that were started during the course of this thesis and to what extent they compare and how they are captured with the LR principles.
* What we learned

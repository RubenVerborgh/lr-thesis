          <p>We observe that majority of the academic knowledge is presented as a package ie. binary file formats (like PDF, Word) merging structural, presentational, and behavioural layers, and often disconnected from other knowledge, due to policy, cost, or technical reasons. A side-effect is that, as research communication is still primarily driven by the constraints of the print medium, it makes it challenging for efficient machine-readable coordination on the Web. One open challenge here is the continuous advancement of creating, communicating, and consuming human and machine-accessible information suitable for the Web platform.</p>

          <p>In the earlier sections, we have discussed progress in research, standards, and practices towards different aspects of realising a decentralised information space. Each dataspace can be individually controlled with access controls for participating agents. Different applications can be implemented to operate on the same data, as well as send activities about the interactions about the data. In this section, we specifically discuss a set of requirements for the implementation of a clientside editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions.</p>

          <p>By <q>Web publishing</q>, we include the notions of authoring and publishing any kind of unit of information for human and machine consumption, relating and linking to globally identifiable units of information, as well as their dissemination.</p>

          <p>Finally, we will discuss the <a href="#dokieli-forces-functions">forces and functions in dokieli</a>.</p>

          <p>This section outlines key features and discusses design decisions made in dokieli as a domain-independent clientside application, and focuses its application in scholarly communication. I have original developed and am the maintainer of dokieli. I have served as an editor of W3C Note <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-html/" rel="cito:citesAsAuthority">Embedding Web Annotations in HTML</a></cite> as part of the W3C Web Annotation Working Group.</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Decentralised Linked Notifications and Annotations</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>The functional and non-functional requirements from the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-ucr/">Linked Data Platform Use Cases and Requirements</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Platform Use Cases and Requirements">LDP-UCR</abbr>) are applicable for authoring, publishing, and sharing content. In order to represent different units of information in social and scholarly communication, Linked Data <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#vocabularies">vocabularies</a> can be used.</p>

              <p>By using different arrangements of LDN, WA, AP, LDP mechanisms and related vocabularies, scholarly and social activities can be systematically discovered for a variety of use cases. Decentralised notifications and annotations surrounding an article can be determined as follows:</p>

              <ul>
                <li id="subject-annotation-service">Resource asserts the location of a preferred service for maintaining annotations about the the subject resource (via <code>oa:annotationService</code>)</li>
                <li id="subject-inbox">Resource asserts the location of a service that receives and serves notifications about the subject resource (via <code>ldp:inbox</code>)</li>
                <li id="profile-storage">An individual's profile asserting their preferred storage location (via <code>pim:storage</code>)</li>
                <li id="profile-outbox">An individual's profile asserting the location of their activities (via <code>as:outbox</code>)</li>
                <li id="profile-index">An individual's profile asserting their type index registrations (via <code>solid:publicTypeIndex</code>)</li>
                <li id="profile-knows-profile-storage">Members of an individual's social graph (via eg. <code>foaf:knows</code>) asserting their preferred storage location</li>
                <li id="profile-knows-profile-outbox">Members of an individual's social graph asserting the location of their activities</li>
                <li id="profile-knowns-profile-index">Members of an individual's social graph sharing their type index registration (via <code>solid:publicTypeIndex</code>)</li>
                <li id="inbox-annotation-known">Inbox or annotation service locations are known prior to interaction eg. trusted or used by a community.</li>
                <li id="inbox-annotation-manual">Inbox or annotation service locations are manually input to the system eg. not publicised or private.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Applications can incrementally implement a combination of these approaches to deliver and discover distributed activities on the Web. For example, the preferred locations for general data storage, annotations and notifications for resources can be discovered, and used as input to create new resources eg. assigning an inbox for an annotation where the inbox location is derived from a profile's preferred location for a class of information. Thereby a chain of operations can be orchestrated for decentralised units of information.</p>

              <p>Figure X depicts an interplay of decentralised personal profiles, notifications, and annotations.</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Implementing a Read-Write Application</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>In this section we demonstrate how the various standards described can be pieced together into an application designed for researchers to participate in the scholarly communication ecosystem autonomously. We highlight some scholarly communication use cases with <cite><a href="https://dokie.li/">dokieli</a></cite>, a clientside editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions.</p>

              <p>dokieli implements the use cases pertaining to <a href="#decentralised-linked-notifications-and-annotations">Decentralised Linked Notifications and Annotations</a> as outlined earlier, as well as those specific to <a href="linked-data-notifications#scholarly-communication-notification-use-cases">scholarly communication</a>.</p>

              <p>dokieli is inherently a general-purpose authoring, annotating, and notifying application. While it implements use cases specific to research or scholarly communication, it is not constrained to it. For instance, dokieli is capable of rendering the following use cases from the W3C <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/">RDFa Use Cases: Scenarios for Embedding RDF in HTML</a></cite>: <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-1">Basic Structured Blogging</q>, <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-2">Publishing an Event - Overriding Some of the Rendered Data</q>, <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-3">Content Management Metadata</q>, <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-5">Web Clipboard</q>, <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-7">Advanced Data Structures</q>, and <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-8">Augmented Browsing for Scientists</q>, <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-9">Publishing a RDF Vocabulary</q>.</p>

              <p>dokieli uses LDN to send and consume notifications: When a reader comments on a fragment of text in an article, the application discovers the article’s Inbox and sends a notification about the annotation. dokieli also consumes notifications from this Inbox to fetch and display the annotation as marginalia (<a href="#figure-dokieli-annotation">figure 2</a>). A reader can share a dokieli-enabled article with their contacts; dokieli discovers each contact’s Inbox and sends a notification there (<a href="#figure-dokieli-share">figure 3</a>). When editing an article, the author can add a citation. If an Inbox is discovered in the cited article, dokieli sends a notification there to indicate what part of the article was cited by whom and where. dokieli-enabled articles also consume citation notifications to display these metrics for the author and other readers (<a href="#figure-dokieli-citation">figure 4</a>).</p>

              <p>In this section we describe dokieli's architecture along the following main areas:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Actors can use their own WebIDs to identify themselves with, and have their profile information known to dokieli.</li>
                <li>Actors can publish and consume human and machine-readable (Linked Data), and decide where they are made available from and the conditions.</li>
                <li>Actors can use the notification system to announce and consume information, as well as to facilitate discovery and reuse.</li>
              </ul>

              <section id="deployment" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#deployment">
                <h3 property="schema:name">Deployment</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>dokieli employs two complementary deployment approaches: <em>single-page application</em> and <em>Web browser extension</em>.</p>

                  <p id="single-page-application">dokieli’s presentational and behavioural code layers can be included in Web pages in order to trigger them as active single-page applications. It is a smart client that allows different kinds of articles eg. academic, blog posts, news, to be authored and annotated from within Web browsers, without necessarily having them deployed from a server, ie. it can be used offline or on localhost. dokieli internally handles its content and structural and semantic representation based on user’s interactivity. Articles, profiles and their contact information, notifications, annotations with different motivations, for instance, can be read and written ubiquitously to any Web space with supporting HTTP methods and access control mechanisms.</p>

                  <p id="web-browser-extension">The Web browser extension is a thin wrapper around dokieli’s core code in order to embed itself in any HTML-based Web page on the Web. It inherits all of the features of a single-page application. While HTML based documents on the Web vary in their quality, dokieli’s write operations generate HTML+RDFa. One of the utilities for the extension is to have a consistent interface for annotating node or text selections on a Web page, building structured citations, creating derivations of Web resources as well as sharing parts of pages with ones contacts via notifications, without having a service dependency or being limited by the Web page’s UI.</p>

              <section id="information-overview" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#information-overview">
                <h3 property="schema:name">Information Overview</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>Here we summarise the key protocols and data models that dokieli uses. Later, we will describe some key use cases in more detail.</p>

                  <p id="separation-of-concerns"><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>: dokieli adopts <cite>progressive enhancement</cite> strategy for the structural, presentational, and behavioural layers to allow content and base functionality to be accessible through different media and devices. The content representation in HTML+RDFa that dokieli produces is accessible (readable by human and machine consumers) without requiring any CSS or JavaScript, ie. text-browser safe.</p>

                  <p id="human-machine-readable"><strong>Human and Machine-Readable</strong>: <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#why-rdfa">Why RDFa</a> explained having all human-visible content in HTML, and all structured statements be made in context of their content in RDFa, thereby a close association between structured data and visual locality. dokieli takes this approach when preparing documents, also to avoid any data duplication in the same document - adhering to the <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> principle. The approach also helps to avoid the creation and usage of multiple data islands, ie. separately for humans and machines. Consequently, it has the advantage of not having any dependency on JavaScript in order to make the hidden machine-readable content be consumable from a human user interface. One exception to this rule is where dokieli allows authors to use embed Turtle, JSON-LD, or TriG data blocks in HTML typically for the purpose of non-prose information. We cannot know in advance what new kinds of information or data can be integrated into articles. So, dokieli sets no constraints on what information and how it can be be expressed in order to facilitate extensibility. Information can be expressed using different vocabularies, enabling reuse of existing data models and the addition of new semantic expressions.</p>

                  <p id="serialisations"><strong>Serialisations</strong>: dokieli can serialise articles, annotations, and notifications in HTML+RDFa, Turtle, and JSON-LD, depending on server content-negotiation. Articles are represented in HTML+RDFa so that information is usable by both humans and machine consumers while maintaining lowest requirements for publishing, eg. a single URL with full payload in HTML+RDFa can be accessible from any HTTP server. No additional requirements necessary from clients eg. JavaScript support and enabled, or servers eg. additional RDF based content-negotiation. For annotations and notifications, dokieli first meets interoperability requirements (for protocols and vocabularies), and remains flexible about the serialisation that servers prefer. Similarly for consuming content, it can work with any of the serialisations as mentioned.</p>

                  <p id="notification-inbox"><strong>Notification Inbox</strong>: An article or an arbitrary unit of information within may be associated with a notification inbox as per LDN's <code>ldp:inbox</code>. Articles containing the inbox relation is detected by dokieli, and used to send notifications about annotations that the user creates. While orthogonal, articles and inboxes can also preserve context in that a unique inbox can be associated with a unique version of an article, so that annotations will refer to the specific version of an article, as well as being specifically recalled through the unique inbox. dokieli also enables users to assign an inbox for the annotation that they are creating. This has the advantage that the annotation has its own inbox and it can be discovered by other means. This approach is supplemental to threaded annotations, ie. annotations on annotations, and can be used independently of the primary article. The assignment of the inbox comes from user's preferred location for an inbox for the purpose of announcements. It is based on Solid's Type Index Registration approach.</p>

                  <p id="annotation-service"><strong>Annotation Service</strong>: Articles can be associated with an annotation service located anywhere on the Web as per WA's <code>oa:annotationService</code>. Articles containing the annotation service relation is detected by dokieli, and offered as an optional location to send annotations to.</p>

                  <p id="license"><strong>License</strong>: Actors can assign any license and rights to their documents or any fragment within. All of the Creative Commons licenses are available from the dokieli UI for actors to use for articles and annotations. Notifications are licensed with CC0 1.0 Universal (public domain dedication).</p>

                  <p>dokieli applies the notion of articles, annotations, notifications, and profiles as described in <a href="structure-of-scholarly-informationunits-of-communication">Units of Communication</a>. Creating articles, annotations, and notifications in dokieli is intended to be done through its UI, and generates the required structured content.</p>

                  <p id="dokieli-articles"><strong>Articles</strong>: An article - in the most general sense of the term - may contain RDF classes like <code>schema:CreativeWork</code>, <code>sioc:Post</code>, <code>prov:Entity</code>, <code>schema:Article</code>, <code>as:Article</code>. While the body of annotations may also considered as articles in their own right, we reserve the usage of the term articles in particular to primary research documents typically containing structured prose. Actors can assign unique identifiers to any fragment of information.</p>

                  <p id="dokieli-annotations"><strong>Annotations</strong>: dokieli uses the Web Annotation <cite>Data Model</cite> and <cite>Vocabulary</cite> to express the annotations it creates, as well as implementing the Web Annotation <cite>Protocol</cite> in order to communicate with conforming annotation servers. dokieli initially prepares the annotation using the <cite>Embedding Web Annotations in HTML</cite> approach using RDFa, while subject to be re-serialised depending on content-negotiation. In fact, the examples in the W3C Note were derived from dokieli's application of the WA model and vocabulary for HTML+RDFa representations. An annotation has the <code>oa:Annotation</code> RDF class, contains a link to its body content and the target resource in which it is associated with. dokieli also uses the WA <cite>Selectors and States</cite> for selecting part of a resource and generating a dereferenceable HTTP URI. Annotations can be done at the document as well as sentence level.</p>

                  <p id="dokieli-notifications"><strong>Notifications</strong>: dokieli implements the LDN protocol to discover social and scholarly activities, such as annotations with different motivations, as well as sending contextual notifications to recipients (like documents or web-agents). A notification may have one of the following classes: <code>as:Announce</code>, <code>as:Like</code>, <code>as:Dislike</code>, <code>as:Relationship</code>.</p>

                  <p id="profiles"><strong>Profiles</strong>: Actors can use their personal WebIDs, and profile descriptions when interacting with the Web resources.</p>

              <section id="http-operations" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#http-operations">
                <h3 property="schema:name">HTTP Operations</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>dokieli implements the <a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#crud-http">HTTP based CRUD operations</a> - create, update, and delete operations - and in particular, conforms to some of the clientside operations expected to communicate with LDP implementations.</p>

                  <p>Before dokieli makes a write request to a server, it triggers content-negotiation through <code>OPTIONS</code> and checks for <code>Allow</code> and <code>Accept-Post</code> headers in order to determine server's preferences. In the absence of successful negotiation, dokieli proceeds to make the request as per the required parameters of LDN, WAP, AP, and LDN. For example, <code>HTTP POST</code> with <code>application/ld+json</code> content type would be used for annotations and notifications, if a server's preference is not determined.</p>

                  <p>Articles typically use <code>text/html</code> with embedded RDFa. Where a server implements <code>GET</code> with <code>text/html</code>, and allows <code>PUT</code> for writing, the assumption is that it can allow payloads with <code>text/html</code> content type. HTML+RDFa is considered to be an important default for articles for being human and machine-readable. Hence, if a server is capable of handling HTML+RDFa, it will receive articles, annotations, and notifications in that form. Otherwise, dokieli will re-serialize the content into an alternative RDF syntax that the server prefers or capable of handling.</p>

                  <p><code>HTTP GET</code> is used to read resources. Article-level actions like <cite>New</cite>, <cite>Save</cite>, <cite>Save As</cite>, <cite>Reply</cite> use <code>HTTP PUT</code>. All annotation actions, notifications, as well as archiving functions use <code>HTTP POST</code> as per WAP, AP, and LDN.</p>

                  <aside id="http-patch">
                    <p>As of this writing, the reasons to use <code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>PUT</code> for articles instead of <code>PATCH</code> are as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Servers with <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5261" rel="cito:citesAsAuthority">XML Patch</a></cite> and mediatype <code>application/xml-patch+xml</code> (<cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7351" rel="cito:citesAsAuthority">RFC 7351</a></cite>) capability in the Linked Data ecosystem are not well supported.</li>

                      <li><code>HTTP PATCH</code> with <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/" rel="cito:citesAsAuthority">SPARQL Update</a></cite> (using mediatype <code>application/sparql-update</code>) would not work for RDFa representations because it would require additional server-side knowledge: HTML+RDFa serializer. This also makes server implementations a dependency for dokieli which is an undesirable design pattern.</li>

                      <li><code>HTTP PATCH</code> can help to optimise HTTP requests provided that the server processes the SPARQL query and eventually publishes the final state of the article. dokieli's use of <code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> on the other hand does not expect or impose operations other than to store and serve the article. If servers would like to do versioning and how, dokieli leaves it to the servers to decide.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </aside>

                  <p id="mixed-content">Due to <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mixed-content/">Mixed Content</a></cite> implementations in Web browsers, ie. <q>fetching of content over unencrypted or unauthenticated connections in the context of an encrypted and authenticated document</q>, is subject to being blocked by the Web browser. Hence, a document available from <code>https:</code> will not be able to use the contents of a document available from <code>http:</code>. As a workaround, dokieli implements the notion of using a <a href="#preferred proxy">preferred proxy</a> that a user-agent can use in order to access the contents of an http resource. An https document fetching an https resource will not use the proxy.</p>

                  <p id="profile-description"><strong>Profile Description</strong>: In order to adopt dokieli's user-interface and the kinds of interactions that a user can perform, we dereference the user's <a href="#webid">WebID</a> (HTTP URI), and parse the <a href="#webid-profile">WebID Profile</a> document to glean the following kinds of information:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Name (eg. <code>foaf:name</code> and equivalents)</li>
                    <li>Image (eg. <code>foaf:image</code> and equivalents)</li>
                    <li>Homepage (eg. <code>foaf:homepage</code> and equivalents)</li>

                    <li><a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#pds">Storage</a> (<code>pim:storage</code>)</li>
                    <li><a href="linked-data-notifications#inbox-notification">Inbox</a> (<code>ldp:inbox</code>, and alias <code>as:inbox</code>)</li>
                    <li><a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#activitypub">Outbox</a> (<code>as:outbox</code>)</li>
                    <li>Preferences (<code>pim:preferencesFile</code>, <code>solid:publicTypeIndex</code>, <code>solid:privateTypeIndex</code>)</li>
                    <li>Preferred proxy (<code>solid:preferredProxy</code>)</li>
                    <li><a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#multiple-identities">Multiple identities</a> (<code>owl:sameAs</code>)</li>
                    <li>Additional information (<code>rdfs:seeAlso</code>)</li>
                    <li><a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#webid-tls-delegation">Delegated agent</a> (<code>acl:delegates</code>)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>When dokieli encounters <code>owl:sameAs</code> and <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> relations in WebID Profiles, it traverses the resources continuously to mine for relevant information. The reason for this is both, to discover, as well as to fuse a graph that can be used to adopt the interface and the possible interactions. For example, driven by <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#follow-your-nose">follow-your-nose</a> type of exploration, a human-readable name, an inbox relation, list of contacts, and other information can be put together by looking at the interconnected identity graph that is semantically associated.</p>

                  <p>The appearance of documents is determined with CSS3. Different stylesheets can be applied to the same HTML structure so that a document can be presented flexibly, in the most appropriate way for a particular circumstance. Stylesheets can be switched from either dokieli’s menu or through Web browser with native controls, for example from a two-column layout required by an academic journal to a design in keeping with the author’s blog.</p>

                  <p>When JavaScript is enabled on the clientside, dokieli provides a rich editing interface which includes visual and structural formatting of text as well as embedding machine-readable semantics, media, dynamic citations, and inclusion of statistical charts from live endpoints. An external personal data store, or even internet connection, are not needed at this stage as modifications to a document made in the browser this way can be persisted to a local filesystem using the dokieli menu <em>export</em> function (or the browser’s <em>save as</em>), or through browser’s native local storage.</p>

                  <p>Once the annotation is created and has a dereferenceable HTTP URI (subject to access control rules), a notification can be sent to the inbox of the target resource about the annotation if an article or arbitrary parts advertises an LDN inbox. Depending on the motivation of the annotation, the notification is modelled with the <cite>Activity vocabulary</cite> eg. the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-create">Create</a> activity (<code>as:Create</code>), to indicate that the actor has created the object.</p>

                  <p>In order to discover and view previously created annotations around article, dokieli follows LDN's discovery mechanism for notifications about annotations, and then subsequently fetches the annotations in order to display them in context of what they are associated with.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>The mechanism for personal identities, social graphs, and self-publishing articles and annotations enables a new layer of decentralised interactions. Here we describe how actors can discover units of information created or annotated in response to Web resources (like articles) by their social network without intermediaries (which includes the authors of the article or the features supported by the server it is published at). This scenario expands on <em>identity A knows identity B</em>, and <em>identity B has a <a href="#profile-knows-profile-storage">storage</a> or <a href="#profile-knows-profile-outbox">outbox</a></em> as declared in <a href="#decentralised-linked-notifications-and-annotations">Decentralised Linked Notifications and Annotations</a>.</p>

                  <p>As each unit of information can be independently published and made accessible by an actor, one way to discover the information is by determining the relation between their WebID and the location of their collection of artefacts eg. under their personal storage (<code>pim:storage</code>) or activity outbox (<code>as:outbox</code>). The second connection between the actor that is interested in discovering such information and the actors which created them (<code>foaf:knows</code>). Hence, we are able to discover the reactions (like replies, comments, approvals, questioning, or annotations in general) made by the members of an actor's social graph.</p>

                  <p>In order to realise this scenario, the required components are as follows:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Actor A wants to read annotations or activities around a unit of information.</li>
                    <li>Actor A knows actor B.</li>
                    <li>Actor B has a collection of artefacts.</li>
                    <li>Actor A has read access to Actor B's activity collection.</li>
                    <li>Actor A's application associates the unit of interest with actor B's annotation or activity.</li>
                    <li>Actor A's application displays the annotation in context of the unit of information.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>As these components are solely based on interoperable standards, any conforming application is able to interact with, and perhaps more importantly, is not subject to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">vendor lock-in</a>.</p>

                  <p>This scenario is realised in dokieli, and works as a single-page application or via the Web Extension. The Web Extension enables a new dimension to discovering and consuming independently published activities in that, a user can navigate to any HTTP URL and potentially discover and interact with annotations made by their network. Thereby, a layer of decentralised and linked research space can exist independently, where any ordinary Web resource (article) can be incorporated into the social or research discourse.</p>

                  <p>As each annotation (or unit of information) can have its own inbox, subsequent interactions with the annotation can be both stored at the annotator's storage and notified at the advertised inbox. This further decouples the components required to publish and consume content on the Web in an interoperable way. The decentralised activities in dokieli demonstrates the utility of independent publishing, semantic relations, as well as extensibility.</p>

Contacts whose profiles advertise an LDN Inbox will receive a notification of the share. The notification is modelled with the Activity vocabulary, eg. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-announce">Announce</a>, to indicate that the actor is calling the target's attention the object.

                  <p><a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#publishing-and-referencing">Publishing and Referencing</a> and <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#scientific-expressions">Scientific Expressions</a> described some of the existing specifications to identify, integrate, and link assertions in research. The registration of units of information with URIs enables us to create RDF relations between them for the purpose of research citations. For example, actors can link specific statements within and across resources, as well as annotate their intentions.</p>

                  <p id="inline-citations"><strong>Inline Citations</strong>: One way to create a citation in dokieli is by authors selecting a node or a text fragment of interest in their document, and then inserting the URI of the resource to be linked to, as well as a specifying the type of semantic link between them in a specific or general way using the classifications available from the CiTO ontology eg. using <q>agrees with</q>, <q>confirms</q>, <q class="highlight-cites-as-evidence">cites as evidence</q>. The input for the cited entity can be any HTTP URI, DOI string, or <abbr title="International Standard Serial Number">ISSN</abbr> string, and when resolved from a corresponding HTTP URL, the content in RDF is used towards constructing the citation dokieli takes the input target URI, and retrieves data (like title, authors) expressed in RDF in the linked document, integrates the statement expressed in RDF (eg. figure <a href="#example-cites-as-evidence">cites as evidence</a>) in context of the content, and adds a scientific endnote reference including the retrieved information.</p>

                  <figure class="listing" id="example-cites-as-evidence">

                  </figure>

                  <p>Citing units of information in dokieli also introduces a citable unit, thereby the registration of a unit which can be semantically annotated as well as extended in any way the author deems useful.</p>

                  <p id="notifying-cited-entity"><strong>Notifying Cited Entity</strong>: Once a citation is made through the dokieli user interface, dokieli proceeds to check if the cited article advertises its own LDN inbox, and if so, sends a notification to indicate the citation function. This notification serves as an announcement for the back-reference, ie. being informed that a citation was made and thus creating discoverable bi-directional linking between the units of information. With the help of an inbox consumer, like dokieli, the cited article can also inform the reader about the back-references out there on the Web.</p>

                  <p>The following screenscast illustrates a clientside interaction in dokieli where the user cites a unit of information with a particular relationship, and a notification sent to the cited entity's inbox.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>Creating awareness and enabling actors to protect their data privacy is essential to fostering user's trust in the systems they use. The adoption of standards and practices with different <a href="#degree-of-control">degrees of control</a> can yield different privacy measures. In the decentralised and interoperable environment that dokieli operates in, there are a number of challenges and approaches. We discuss user privacy, data privacy, preferred proxy, and private activities below. The terms <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, and <q>pseudonymity</q> follow the definitions from <cite><a data-versiondate="2019-01-28T12:06:31Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20190128120631/http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf" href="http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf">A terminology for talking about privacy by data minimization: Anonymity, Unlinkability, Undetectability, Unobservability, Pseudonymity, and Identity Management</a></cite>, Pfitzmann et al, 2010.</p>

                  <p id="user-privacy"><strong>User Privacy</strong>: dokieli acts as a conduit to perform read-write operations against <abbr title="Personal Data Store">PDS</abbr>. As the rules for read-write operations are set by servers, dokieli does not require the creation of user accounts at any server, in order to interact with the server's resources. Where applicable, actors can participate by maintaining their <em>anonymity</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, or can choose to identify themselves to dokieli by using their preferred <a href="#personal-identities">personal identities</a>, without necessarily disclosing "real" information. Actors authenticate against the servers they prefer in order to perform access-controlled actions. It is possible for the environment in which dokieli operates in transmits device, machine, or browser fingerprint, thereby potentially risking <em>unlinkability</em>.</p>

                  <p id="data-privacy"><strong>Data Privacy</strong>: With respect to data privacy, actors can exercise their autonomy through the use of PDS for their profiles, articles, annotations, and notifications. As a <a href="#pds-expectation">PDS can provide</a> us with the means to safeguard data, dokieli as a clientside application enables actors to perform <a href="#read-write-linked-data">read-write Linked Data</a> operations where they prefer under their own conditions. With the help of access controls, a PDS that dokieli communicates with can potentially fulfill all minimizations - <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, <q>pseudonymity</q> - possibly with the exception of the domain name and IP that the PDS operates from.</p>

                  <p id="preferred-proxy"><strong>Preferred Proxy</strong>: A proxy acts as an intermediary between the clientside application and the destination server. This is useful in a number of scenarios for dokieli, such as getting around <a href="#mixed-content">Mixed Content</a> issues, absence of <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a></cite> (<abbr title="Cross-Origin Resource Sharing">CORS</abbr>) support, as well as concealing the identity of the actor, fulfilling <em>anonymity</em>, <em>unlinkability</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, when making requests to a target server. An actor's preferred proxy can be determined by checking their WebID Profile description for the <code>solid:preferredProxy</code> relation, and if found, dokieli can use it to route requests when needed. Alternatively, a built-in (but user configurable) proxy location in dokieli is used.</p>

                  <p id="private-activities"><strong>Private Activities</strong>: The ability for actors to create and discover <a href="#activities">activities</a> made within their social network without going through intermediaries, makes it possible to isolate units of information that is both access-controlled and invisible (or be unknown) to third-parties. These class of interactions in dokieli is aligned with the notion of <em>undetectability</em> and <em>unobservability</em>.</p>

With an ontology and a user interface appropriate for the type of content, semantic authoring can be easier than traditional composition of content and the resulting content can be of higher quality.</q> The article proposes a set of <q>quality attributes</q> - as non-functional requirements - to evaluate the performance of SCA systems: usability, customizability, generalizability, collaboration, portability, accessibility, proactivity, automation, evolvability, interoperability, and scalability. Based on the starting point of the authoring process, the authors distinguish the approaches, and generally categorised as <q>bottom-up</q> (lifting unstructured content to a semantic level) or <q>top-down</q> (semantic representations from the beginning requiring users with the knowledge of the domain), and sometimes a hybrid of the two. A survey of tools are presented (in article's Table 3) covering different types of users, expected domain knowledge, and authoring approach. The article also discusses <cite>Research and Technology Challenges</cite> and identifies a gap in addressing <q>accessibility</q>, <q>handling complexity in UIs</q>, <q>formal and systematic methods for user interface evaluation</q>, <q>heuristic evaluation</q>, <q>support of crowdsourcing</q>, UIs for ubiquitous devices.</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Overview of Web Publishing Platforms</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>Throughout this article we have emphasised on the fundamentals of the Web architecture, Web standards and best practices with the goal of fostering interoperable information space, as well as ongoing initiatives towards the decoupling of functions in scientific communication. Hence, we reuse some of these notions to situate dokieli with the existing work on Web publishing. We focus on degree of control with respect to applications, data and identity, privacy, accessibility, and interoperability.</p>

              <p>Authoring and publishing platforms include varying characteristics of centralisation and decentralisation. It is a continuum.</p>

              <p>There is plethora of examples for centralised systems on the Web. Here we have highlight some of the platforms that are commonly known today and discuss their key architectural approaches. <span id="googledocs-medium-mediawiki"><cite><a href="https://docs.google.com/" rel="cito:discusses">Google Docs</a></cite>, <cite><a href="https://medium.com/" rel="cito:discusses">Medium</a></cite>, and <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia" rel="cito:discusses">Wikipedia</a></cite> (running <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki" rel="cito:discusses">MediaWiki</a></cite>) are examples of Web applications for collaborative creation and publication of content.</span></p>

              <p><span id="wordpress"><cite><a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="cito:discusses">WordPress</a></cite> is a free and open-source platform for article publication which can be self-hosted on a server controlled by the user. Visitors may sign-in with their WordPress accounts to leave comments on others’ articles, however they are typically stored by the hosting site’s database.</span><p>

              <p><span id="hypothes.is"><cite><a href="https://hypothes.is/" rel="cito:discusses">Hypothes.is</a></cite> is a server and client application that makes it possible for users to leave annotations on different types of documents on the Web using a browser extension via their proxy server. Annotations may be private or public, and can be threaded to form conversations around a piece of content. Despite allowing the attachment of annotations to resources hosted anywhere, it depends on centralised user accounts and storage space for the annotations themselves. User identity can be configured to authenticate with ORCID. A Hypothes.is client application is preconfigured to use an annotation server. Annotations can be self-hosted, however the servers do not federate.</span></p>

              <p>These systems require individual account creation and data storage with respective to their centralised services. They allow multiple participants to annotate and hold discussions around the primary content; users must access their accounts to be notified of updates to conversations, and data from both the main content and related discussion is confined to the service which was used to create it.</p>

              <p><span id="libreoffice-online">Some of the authoring and publishing systems already fulfill some aspects of decentralised systems. <cite><a href="https://github.com/libreoffice/online" rel="cito:discusses">LibreOffice Online</a></cite>'s <cite>Writer</cite>, for example, allows collaborative editing of office documents from the Web browser. Content can be stored under different CMSs in the cloud. The document’s interface consists of image tiles which are sent from the server and rendered in the browser. However, it hardly provides accessibility, rich interlinking and annotations or <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#separation-of-concerns">separations of concerns</a>.</span></p>

              <p><span id="pandoc-scholar"><cite><a rel="cito:discusses" href="https://github.com/pandoc-scholar/pandoc-scholar">Pandoc Scholar</a></cite> manuscripts to be written in plain Markdown text files, which can be converted into common publication formats, such as PDF, HTML or EPUB, using Pandoc (<a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-112/">Formatting Open Science: agilely creating multiple document formats for academic manuscripts with Pandoc Scholar</a>, Krewinkel, 2017).</span>

              <p><span id="smallest-federated-wiki">The <cite><a href="http://fed.wiki.org/" rel="cito:discusses">Smallest Federated Wiki</a></cite> pages to be forked and maintain personal copies.</span></p>

              <p><span id="amaya"><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/Amaya/" rel="cito:discusses">Amaya</a></cite> is a desktop Web editor application, to create and update documents with remote access features, as well as a lightweight browser that was developed by W3C (1996-2012) to provide a framework to test its technologies. Annotations in Amaya can be attached to a Web document or a selected part of the document (without modifying the primary document) and stored locally or on a remote annotation server.</span></p>



              <p>Publicly archivable?</p>
              <p>Degree of interoperability of the protocols and formats: </p>

              <p>Level of interop.. does it create stuff that's standards compliant?</p>

              <p>can others use it? can it discover others stuff? can it reuse others stuff? is the reused and revised/enhanced reusable by other applications?</p>

              <p>The tools which provide good collaborative editing user-interfaces appear to do so at the expense of data ownership and interoperability; those which promote creation and publication of data in open reusable formats are lacking facilities for linking discourse and conversation to concepts published. Decentralised creations also mean that each author can choose their own semantics eg. their own vocabulary to annotate using the RDF language, and then such decentralised documents can link to each other and their schemas can also be mapped to each other, whereas in centralised platforms this is (if they support semantics at all) often prescribed, either technically enforced, or encouraged by social convention.</p>

              <p>A tentative view of the interoperability between Hypothes.is and dokieli is as follows. The client applications Hypothes.is and dokieli are non-conflicting in that when used in the same content or context, each can still be used on its own. A Hypothes.is client application can search and fetch annotations from a server using the Hypothes.is API, and render them on the target resource. dokieli can discover the WA annotation service of a Web resource, fetch annotations from servers conforming to the WAP and LDP, and render them on the target resource. Additional data about the annotation can be shown in both applications. A Hypothes.is client application can authenticate with a particular server using OAuth. Actors with WebID in dokieli can authenticate with servers supporting WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. Both can create annotations given authorization. Hypothes.is application can extend and direct annotations to a group using the same server. dokieli uses the HTTP <code>OPTIONS</code> method to determine the communication options from servers based on WAP and LDP, and adopts for subsequent requests eg. triggers content negotiation with servers to determine preferred RDF serialization of Web Annotation and profile. The Hypothes.is client can only fetch annotations from a corresponding Hypothes.is server. dokieli can only fetch annotations from servers implementing LDP or WAP. Method of annotation fetching aside, it is possible for either client application to render an annotation serialized as JSON-LD that is created by the other application.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>This section goes into detail about how dokieli fulfills or supports some of the forces and functions in scientific communication.</p>

              <p id="dokieli-forces">As dokieli is employed, we observe the <em>forces</em>:</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Actor</dt>
                <dd>Any <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#def-web-agent">web agent</q> — person or software — can use WebIDs for their identities when participating in reading and writing resources. Actors may also contribute anonymously, be pseudonymous, or unlinkable. Applications like dokieli can follow links in an actor's profile description to discover the members of their social network.</dd>

                <dt>Content</dt>
                <dd>Actors can author, publish, and reuse Web resources, including articles, annotations, notifications, as well as query statistical data and lookup citation references. Any fragment of <a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#axiom-0a">resource of significance</a> can be assigned a URI. Information in dokieli is automatically expressed by the application for certain aspects of units of information or explicitly expressed by the actor using suitable Linked Data <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#vocabularies">vocabularies</a>.</dd>

                <dt>Accessibility</dt>
                <dd>Actors can access publicly available HTTP URIs directly or authenticate themselves in order to retrieve representations of access controlled resources - including articles, annotations, and notifications - provided that they are authorized to. Actors can set access rules on resources they control.</dd>

                <dt>Applicability</dt>
                <dd>Applicability of scholarly communication comes from research which responds to problems or answers questions, which can be used or built upon by others. dokieli makes it possible to both express and share units of information pertaining to applicability.</dd>
              </dl>

              <p id="dokieli-functions">The <em>functions</em>:</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Registration</dt>
                <dd>Articles, annotations, and notifications can be registered as their own entities by assigning HTTP URIs at any location the actor has ownership or access to, facilitating information discovery and reuse. Registration of units of information are triggered by dokieli and then realised by servers.</dd>

                <dt>Awareness</dt>
                <dd>The LDN protocol is used to disseminate notifications to document, profile, or community managed scholarly communication inboxes. The kind of notifications range from information sharing, request for feedback, replies, reviews or annotations of resources, to bringing attention to citation back-references.</dd>

                <dt>Certification</dt>
                <dd>Units of information at any level of granularity can be annotated or replied to, from entire articles to individual data points as part of quality-control. All artefacts for the purpose of quality-control are registered units of information that can be dereferenced, and can be announced to any party of interest; inboxes of individuals and scholarly communities.</dd>

                <dt>Archiving</dt>
                <dd>dokieli can inform the APIs of archiving systems (in the form of an annotation) about the existence and state of units of information that can be crawled and preserved.</dd>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>dokieli shows it is possible to build a social machine wherein people interact with each other without the need of centralised coordination. Users can choose storage space for their content independently of the applications with which they edit and view that content. Documents are connected statically through links and dynamically through Linked Data Notifications. This is a proof for the viability of a decentralised authoring and annotation environment built with Web standards.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, dokieli’s use of standards shows that dokieli itself is only one means to an end: once the document has been created, it lives on independently. The social machine consists of people and documents, connected by Web standards, with dokieli acting as just one possible catalyst. Different Web applications can incorporate any of dokieli’s functions and implement the principles to varying extents. Since the data is loosely coupled to the application, we avoid the <em>walled garden</em> problem of many current social platforms today.</p>

              <p>We propose a shift in scholarly communication: adoption of <em>native</em> Web technologies and standards declaratively from ground up; authoring, publishing and consuming, in order to improve the quality of knowledge representation and acquisition on the Web. Researchers should control and make their knowledge accessible to the greatest extent possible. Our argument is antithetical to knowledge extraction methods from non-machine processable documents, post-publishing semantic uplifting, as well as inadequate user experiences in context of the Web. In our approach, we adopt Web technologies which are designed with the principles to evolve and have information accessible to many.</p>

              <p>A couple of important socio-technical challenges remain. Resources might want to indicate in a granular way which actions they support or encourage, such as liking, bookmarking, or sharing, and perhaps conditions about which notifications should be sent when any of these events take place. In order to encourage positive behaviour, we might want ways to provide moderation, and solutions to prevent harassment and abuse. Closely related is the issue of identity, pseudonymity and anonymity, and its relation with trust and verification. While there is likely no final solution to these issues in an open ecosystem, it is worthwhile exploring within dokieli or other tools based on similar design principles.</p>

              <p>Future work can examine how additional features can be realised on top of existing Web standards, or where more development is required. Real-time collaborative editing is often realised with centralised communication (even though some peer to peer alternatives exist). Services like top-down annotations or automated entity marking can improve the discoverability of a publication, yet the question of how to offer these without being tied to certain servers needs to be still solved.</p>

              <p class="todo">Social implications of dokieli Web Extension and social graph. For instance, the ability of annotating and sharing information even if the primary article doesn't have an inbox or offers an annotation service. There is no 'admin' that oversees everything, but that each actor has control privileges to whatever they are given. Having the ability ot annotate anything and store it at a preferred location gives an actor their autonomy. This can be contrasted with annotation systems that may restricts annotations being created with particular targets or annotations having particular information in its body.</p>

              <p class="todo">Mention dokieli happens to be one application that demonstrates the potentials of decentralised notifications and annotations. The information it creates does not result in a vendor lock-in, as other applications are able to reuse them.</p>

          <p>Academic articles are commonly represented in packages, like binary file formats (PDF, Word) merging structural, presentational, and behavioural layers. Such forms are often disconnected from other knowledge, in that navigation from one unit of information to another is non-continuous or not uniformly accessible and usable by both human and machine users. This is generally due to historical policy, cost, and social or technical reasons intertwined with the systems around units of scholarly communication. One side-effect of scholarly publication still being primarily driven by the constraints of print media in this way is that it is challenging for efficient machine-readable coordination on the Web, as well as for continuous advancement of creating, communicating, and consuming information as part of the <abbr title="Open Web Platform">OWP</abbr>.</p>

          <p>I have covered existing initiatives and progress in research, standards, and practices towards different aspects of realising a decentralised information space. Each dataspace can be individually controlled with access controls for participating agents. Different applications can be implemented to operate on the same data, as well as send activities about the interactions with the data.</p>

          <p>This section addresses the following <a href="introduction#research-questions">research question</a> for this thesis:</p>

          <blockquote id="addresses-research-question">
            How can a client application engage in registration, awareness, certification and archiving so that actors can autonomously cooperate in reading and writing access-controlled decentralised structured data?
          </blockquote>

          <p id="requirements-web-publishing">To this end, I will discuss a set of requirements for software implementations which combine the various technologies and concepts into a complete package which enables decentralised publishing of articles and globally identifiable units of information, annotations and social interactions on the Web, as well as their linking and dissemination. I note the overarching influence of the concept of <cite><a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#degree-of-control">Degree of Control</a></cite>. Such software must enable:</p>

           <ul>
            <li>Creating human and machine-readable Web resources.</li>
            <li>Socially-aware operations using Linked Data Notifications and Web Annotations.</li>
            <li>Actors to use their preferred WebID in clientside applications.</li>
            <li>Actors to use their preferred clientside application to perform HTTP-based read-write operations on resources they are authorised to.</li>
            <li>Actors to switch between applications without having to alter the schema of their data.</li>
            <li>Actors to move data between servers or datastores without having to change their preferred application.</li>
            <li>Querying and visualising [statistical] data from clientside applications.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These requirements are met by <cite><a href="https://dokie.li/">dokieli</a></cite>, a domain-independent clientside authoring and publishing application that is loosely coupled with a data server. This section outlines key features and discusses design decisions made for this implementation. I will focus on various aspects of the application, with some use cases specific to scholarly communication, and examine the <a href="#dokieli-forces-functions">forces and functions in dokieli</a>.</p>

          <p>The implementation of dokieli is a core contribution of this thesis, and serves as a culmination of the various background research, Web standards work, and advocacy I have done so far. It is a proof-of-concept (rather than a <q>production-ready</q> piece of software) which showcases various disparate parts - Web standards, technologies, and social ideals - coming together in a cohesive way to serve a future scholarly communication ecosystem which takes full advantage of the capabilities of the Web.</p>

          <p>dokieli is not intended to be <em>the</em> solution for decentralised academic publishing and communication. My contribution is not the implementation itself, but rather the deep exploration and demonstration of how the, often complex and controversial, moving parts of the scholarly communications ecosystem can come together. What is presented here is a description of the state of the work at the time of writing. It is intended as a conceptual guide or model, and a minimum-viable baseline to be bettered by future developers and researchers. Certain development decisions were made based on existing literature, development, and observations in the relevant fields, which are discussed throughout the prior sections of this thesis. The major undertaking here was to develop dokieli with a thorough analysis of the technical possibilities of the Web <em>as well as</em> the social context in which academic researchers currently find themselves. This is not a quick-fix or a patch, but an ongoing and lengthy iterative process. It is my hope that future tooling built to support the forces and functions in decentralised scholarly communication can build upon the rationale for the ways in which dokieli is designed, and learn from the things that work and the things that do not.</p>

          <p>While I am the original developer of dokieli, the code is <a href="http://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli">open source, maintained it in public</a>, and accepts <a href="https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli/#contributors">attributed community contributions</a>. As a direct result of my work on dokieli I have also contributed to and been influenced by the following:</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>By using different arrangements of LDN, WA, AP, LDP mechanisms and as well as relevant Linked Data vocabularies, scholarly and social activities can be systematically created, linked, discovered, and reused for a variety of use cases. In this section, I present an overview of <em>a</em> decentralised information space including actor profiles, notifications, and annotations. As units of information are structured and semantically interconnected, it forms a knowledge graph with the following key components with respect to technical specifications and practices:</p>

              <ul>
                <li id="subject-annotation-service">Assertion of preferred service for maintaining annotations about the subject resource (via <code>oa:annotationService</code>)</li>
                <li id="subject-inbox">Assertion of a service for receiving and serving notifications about the subject resource (via <code>ldp:inbox</code>)</li>
                <li id="profile-storage">Assertion of preferred storage location (via <code>pim:storage</code>)</li>
                <li id="profile-outbox">Assertion of location of an actor's activities (via <code>as:outbox</code>)</li>
                <li id="profile-index">Assertion of type index registrations (via <code>solid:publicTypeIndex</code>)</li>
                <li id="profile-knows-profile-storage">Members of an actor's social graph (via eg. <code>foaf:knows</code>) asserting their preferred storage location</li>
                <li id="profile-knows-profile-outbox">Members of an actor's social graph asserting the location of their activities</li>
                <li id="profile-knowns-profile-index">Members of an actor's social graph asserting their type index registration (via <code>solid:publicTypeIndex</code>)</li>
                <li id="inbox-annotation-known">Inbox or annotation service locations which are known prior to interaction eg. trusted or used by a community.</li>
                <li id="inbox-annotation-manual">Inbox or annotation service locations which are manually input to the system eg. not publicised or private.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>When discussing "discovery" throughout this section, this means the <a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#follow-your-nose">follow-your-nose</a> approach of using the kinds of links listed above to find relevant services and other resources. Applications can incrementally arrange and implement a combination of these components to deliver and discover distributed activities on the Web - in a similar fashion to the <a href="#paygo">paygo</a> approach. For example, the preferred locations for data storage, annotations and notifications for resources can be used as input to create new resources eg. assigning an inbox for an annotation where the inbox location is derived from a profile's preferred location for a class of information. Thereby a chain of operations can be orchestrated for decentralised units of information. This matches the notion of decoupled functions and reconstructing information flows for a unit of communication as posited in <a href="scholarly-communication-on-the-web#rethinking-scholarly-communication">Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a>.</p>

              <p>dokieli is a general-purpose clientside editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions. While it implements use cases specific to research or scholarly communication, it is not constrained to any knowledge domain or field of work. For instance, dokieli is capable of rendering the following use cases from the W3C <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/">RDFa Use Cases: Scenarios for Embedding RDF in HTML</a></cite>: <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-1">Basic Structured Blogging</q>, <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-2">Publishing an Event - Overriding Some of the Rendered Data</q>, <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-3">Content Management Metadata</q>, <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-5">Web Clipboard</q>, <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-7">Advanced Data Structures</q>, and <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-8">Augmented Browsing for Scientists</q>, <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/#use-case-9">Publishing a RDF Vocabulary</q>. The functional and non-functional requirements from the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-ucr/">Linked Data Platform Use Cases and Requirements</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Platform Use Cases and Requirements">LDP-UCR</abbr>) are also met from the point of expectations of a client application for authoring, publishing, and sharing content with LDP servers.</p>

              <p>dokieli uses <a href="linked-data-notifications">LDN</a> to send and consume notifications. For example, when a reader comments on a fragment of text in an article, the application discovers the article’s Inbox and sends a notification about the annotation. dokieli also consumes notifications from this Inbox to fetch and display the annotation as marginalia (<a href="#figure-dokieli-annotation">figure 2</a>), or indicates the back-references as in the case with citations. A reader can share a dokieli-enabled article with their contacts; dokieli discovers each contact’s Inbox and sends a notification there (<a href="#figure-dokieli-share">figure 3</a>). When editing an article, the author can add a citation. If an Inbox is discovered in the cited article, dokieli sends a notification there to indicate what part of the article was cited by whom and where. dokieli-enabled articles also consume citation notifications to display these metrics for the author and other readers (<a href="#figure-dokieli-citation">figure 4</a>).</p>

              <p>Next I describe dokieli's architecture according to the following capabilities:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Actors use their own WebIDs to identify themselves with, and use their profile information to adapt the user interface.</li>
                <li>Actors publish and consume human and machine-readable Linked Data, and decide where they are made available from and the conditions for access and reuse.</li>
                <li>Actors trigger the notification system to announce, as well as discover relevant information.</li>
              </ul>


              <section id="core-concepts" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#core-concepts">
                <h3 property="schema:name">Core Concepts</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>I summarise the key protocols and data models that dokieli uses in this section. Later, I will describe important use cases in more detail.</p>

                  <p id="separation-of-concerns"><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong>: dokieli adopts <cite>progressive enhancement</cite> strategy for the structural, presentational, and behavioural layers to allow content and base functionality to be accessible through different media and devices. The content representation in HTML+RDFa that dokieli produces is accessible (readable by human and machine consumers) without requiring CSS or JavaScript, ie. text-browser safe, as well as backwards-compatible with the <cite><a href="https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/">WorldWideWeb</a></cite> browser.</p>

                  <p id="human-machine-readable"><strong>Human and Machine-Readable</strong>: <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#why-rdfa">Why RDFa</a> explained having all human-visible content in HTML, and all structured statements be made in context of their content in RDFa, thereby a close association between structured data and visual locality. That is, machine-readable semantics are embedded directly into human-visible prose through RDFa. dokieli takes this approach when preparing documents, also to avoid any data duplication in the same document - adhering to the <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> principle. The approach also helps to avoid the creation and usage of multiple data islands, ie. separately for humans and machines. Consequently, it has the advantage of not having any dependency on JavaScript in order to make the hidden machine-readable content be consumable from a human user interface. One exception to this rule is where dokieli allows authors to embed Turtle, JSON-LD, or TriG data blocks (useful for Nanopublications) in HTML typically for the purpose of including complementary non-prose structured information. We cannot know in advance what new kinds of information or data can be integrated into articles, so to facilitate extensibility, dokieli sets no constraints on what information can be embedded nor how it can be be expressed. Hence, information can be expressed using different vocabularies, enabling reuse of existing data models and the addition of new semantic expressions.</p>

                  <p id="serialisations"><strong>Serialisations</strong>: dokieli can serialise articles, annotations, and notifications in HTML+RDFa, Turtle, and JSON-LD, depending on server content-negotiation. Articles are represented in HTML+RDFa so that information is usable by both humans and machine consumers while maintaining lowest requirements for publishing, eg. a single URL with full payload in HTML+RDFa can be accessible from any HTTP server. No additional requirements are necessary from user-agents (eg. JavaScript support), or servers (eg. content-negotiation). For annotations and notifications, dokieli first meets interoperability requirements (for protocols and vocabularies), and remains flexible about the serialisation that servers prefer. Similarly for consuming content, it can work with any of the serialisations as mentioned. All HTML serialisations use HTML5 <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/" rel="cito:citesAsAuthority">Polyglot Markup</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p id="presentation"><strong>Presentation</strong>: The appearance of HTML in the Web browser is handled with CSS3. Different stylesheets can be applied to the same HTML structure so that a document can be presented flexibly, in the most appropriate way for a particular circumstance, eg. a theme resembling a blog post or a scholarly article. Stylesheets can be switched from either dokieli’s menu or through Web browser with native controls. External stylsheets can also be applied dynamically.</p>

                  <p id="behaviour"><strong>Behaviour</strong>: When JavaScript is enabled on the clientside, dokieli provides a rich editing interface which includes visual and structural formatting of text as well as embedding machine-readable semantics, media, dynamic citations, and inclusion of statistical charts from live endpoints. An Internet connection or a personal data store are not needed at this stage as modifications to a document made in the browser this way can be persisted to a local filesystem using the dokieli menu <em>Export</em> function; the Web browser’s <em>Save Page As</em> function, or through the Web browser’s local storage.</p>

                  <p id="notification-inbox"><strong>Notification Inbox</strong>: An article, or any unit of information within the article, may be associated with a notification inbox using LDN's <code>ldp:inbox</code> property. dokieli detects inbox relations and sends notifications when annotations are created. While orthogonal, articles and inboxes can also preserve context in that a unique inbox can be associated with a unique version of an article, so that annotations will refer to the specific version of an article, as well as being specifically recalled through the unique inbox. dokieli also enables users to assign an inbox for the annotation that they are creating. This has the advantage that the annotation has its own inbox, which means it can stand alone and receive replies, or enable threaded conversation on the article itself. The authors of articles or annotations choose their preferred storage location for notifications and assign their inbox accordingly, based on Solid's Type Index Registration approach. An inbox may also be discovered through an actor's profile and used to send notifications eg. to announce the availability of a new resource.</p>

                  <p id="annotation-service"><strong>Annotation Service</strong>: Articles can be associated with an annotation service located anywhere on the Web with WA's <code>oa:annotationService</code> property. dokieli can detect the annotation service of an article and offer optionally to send annotations there using the WA Protocol.</p>

                  <p id="license"><strong>License</strong>: Actors can assign any license and rights to their documents or any unit of information within. All of the Creative Commons licenses are available from the dokieli UI for actors to use for articles and annotations. Notifications are licensed with <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal</a> (public domain dedication).</p>

                  <p>dokieli applies the notion of articles, annotations, notifications, and profiles as described in <cite><a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#units-of-communication">Units of Communication</a></cite>. dokieli's user interface is used to author articles, annotations, and notifications.</p>

                  <p id="dokieli-articles"><strong>Articles</strong>: An article - in the most general sense of the term - may contain RDF classes like <code>schema:CreativeWork</code>, <code>sioc:Post</code>, <code>prov:Entity</code>, <code>schema:Article</code>, <code>as:Article</code>. While the body of annotations may be also considered as articles in their own right, I reserve the usage of the term articles in particular to primary (research) documents typically containing structured prose. Actors can assign unique identifiers to any fragment of information.</p>

                  <p id="dokieli-annotations"><strong>Annotations</strong>: dokieli uses the Web Annotation <cite>Data Model</cite> and <cite>Vocabulary</cite> to express the annotations it creates, as well as implementing the Web Annotation <cite>Protocol</cite> in order to communicate with conforming annotation servers. dokieli initially prepares the annotation in RDFa using the <cite>Embedding Web Annotations in HTML</cite>, where it may be re-serialised to another RDF syntax depending on content-negotiation with the server. An annotation has the <code>oa:Annotation</code> RDF class, contains a link to its body content and the target resource in which it is associated with. dokieli also uses the WA <cite>Selectors and States</cite> for selecting part of a resource and generating a HTTP URI. Annotations can be done at the document as well as sentence level.</p>

                  <p id="dokieli-notifications"><strong>Notifications</strong>: dokieli implements the LDN protocol to discover social and scholarly activities, such as annotations with different motivations, as well as sending contextual notifications to recipients. A notification may have one of the following classes: <code>as:Announce</code>, <code>as:Like</code>, <code>as:Dislike</code>, <code>as:Relationship</code>.</p>

                  <p id="profiles"><strong>Profiles</strong>: Actors can use their preferred <a href="#webid">WebIDs</a>, and depending on the information available in their <a href="#webid-profile">profile descriptions</a>, the user interface automatically adapts to accommodate their preferences while interacting with Web resources. For instance, the profile description is used to discover an actor's preferred storage locations when creating annotations, as well as discovering their social network in order to send notifications to their inbox.</p>

                  <p id="provenance-memento"><strong>Provenance and Memento</strong>: dokieli can create resources that are derived from other resources, such that provenance data is retained eg. using <code>prov:wasDerivedFrom</code>, <code>prov:generatedAtTime</code>, in the derived copy. Versioned and immutable resources can be created and include information on their history eg. <code>rel:latest-version</code>, <code>rel:predecessor-version</code>. Memento TimeMap is also created to keep references to memento versions of the created resources (using <code>mem:memento</code>), as well as resources linking to their TimeMap with <code>mem:timemap</code>.</p>

                  <p id="resource-archiving"><strong>Resource archiving</strong>: dokieli uses Internet Archive's API to create archived resources and to cite the snapshots with Web Annotations. Actors are able to visit the snapshot URI or reuse by including it back in the document as Robust Links. As per <cite><a href="#archivability">Archivability</a></cite>, as all human and machine-readable (meta)data can be encoded in a static standards-compliant HTML document, they archivable by common on-demand Web archiving services.</p>

                  <p id="robust-links-link-decoration"><strong>Robust Links Link Decoration</strong>: In order to work around content-drift and link-rot, authors of articles can <em>decorate links</em> to include <a href="#robust-links">Robust Links</a>, eg. the URI of a snapshot from the <cite>Internet Archive</cite>, along with the datetime stamp at the time of linking. The application UI shows the versioned URI, as well as the <cite><a data-versiondate="2019-02-15T16:06:09Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20190215160609/http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/" href="http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/">TimeTravel</a></cite> URI that redirects to a Memento of a given resource. The documents also include common date information to provide context for external references eg. through created, published, modified datetime stamps.</p>

                  <p id="composability"><strong>Composability</strong>: Resources generated by dokieli are composable on the data layer as there are semantic relations between units of information, both internally and externally identifiable units. All articles, annotations, and notifications can be assembled in various combinations since they are ultimately expressed using the RDF language, which acts as a layer to describe them at any level of abstraction. All units of information in articles, annotations, and notifications are self-contained, context neutral, globally identifiable and accessible without additional processing. Resources can be versioned, marked as immutable, and archived, thereby treating them as stateless entities on the Web. Another way to reuse the resources is by dynamically embedding them in articles while communicating the original context eg. link to the source, parameters in which an annotation was created. Notifications can serve to show bi-directional linking eg. in citations. Articles and annotations can embed media objects eg. images, videos, audio, or documents, as reusable resources.</p>

                  <p id="identifiers"><strong>Identifiers</strong>: The following kinds of identifiers can be registered (generated or requested by the application and fulfilled by a service):</p>

                  <ul>

                          <p>The term <q>collection</q> (as in WA and AP) is used synonymously with <q>container</q> (as in LDP, LDN).</p>

                  <p>Before dokieli makes a write request to a server, it triggers content-negotiation through <code>HTTP OPTIONS</code> and checks for <code>Allow</code> and <code>Accept-Post</code> HTTP headers in order to determine server's preferences. In the absence of successful negotiation, dokieli proceeds to make the request as per the required parameters of LDN, WAP and AP. For example, <code>HTTP POST</code> with <code>application/ld+json</code> content type would be used for annotations and notifications, if a server's preference is not determined.</p>

                  <p>Articles are by default to be used as <code>text/html</code> media with embedded RDFa. Where a server implements <code>HTTP GET</code> with <code>text/html</code>, and allows <code>HTTP PUT</code> for writing, the assumption is that it can allow payloads with <code>text/html</code> content type. HTML+RDFa is considered to be an important default for articles for being human and machine-readable. Hence, if a server is capable of storing and serving resources in HTML, it will receive articles, annotations, and notifications in that form. Otherwise, dokieli will re-serialize the content into an alternative RDF syntax that the server prefers or is capable of handling per content-negotiation.</p>

                  <aside id="http-patch-articles">
                    <p>As of this writing, the reasons to use <code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> over <code>HTTP PATCH</code>, for documents like articles, are as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Servers with <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5261" rel="cito:citesAsAuthority">XML Patch</a></cite> and mediatype <code>application/xml-patch+xml</code> (<cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7351" rel="cito:citesAsAuthority">RFC 7351</a></cite>) capability in the Linked Data ecosystem are not well supported.</li>

                      <li>Servers implementing <code>HTTP PATCH</code> with <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/" rel="cito:citesAsAuthority">SPARQL Update</a></cite> (using mediatype <code>application/sparql-update</code>) would also need to re-serialize the content eventually as HTML+RDFa.</li>

                      <li><code>HTTP PATCH</code> can help to optimise HTTP requests provided that the server processes the SPARQL query and eventually publishes the final state of the article. dokieli's use of <code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> on the other hand does not particularly expect or impose operations other than to eventually store and serve the resource.</li>

                      <li><code>HTTP POST</code> and <code>HTTP PUT</code> are functionally valid. <code>HTTP PATCH</code> can still be used in the future if server implementations can better handle updates to documents encoded in HTML+RDFa.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </aside>

                  <p id="mixed-content">Due to <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mixed-content/">Mixed Content</a></cite> implementations in Web browsers, ie. <q>fetching of content over unencrypted or unauthenticated connections in the context of an encrypted and authenticated document</q>, is subject to being blocked by the Web browser. Hence, a document available from <code>https:</code> will not be able to use the contents of a document available from <code>http:</code>. As a workaround, dokieli implements the notion of using a <a href="#preferred proxy">preferred proxy</a> that a user-agent can use in order to access the contents of an <code>http:</code> resource. A document on <code>https:</code> fetching an <code>https:</code> resource will not use the proxy.</p>

The workflow for authentication starts by a user inputting their WebID (HTTP URI) or their Identity Provider URL as a shorthand for their WebID into the dokieli UI.

For example, driven by <a href="structure-of-scholarly-information#follow-your-nose">follow-your-nose</a> type of exploration, a human-readable name, an inbox relation, list of contacts, and other information can be put together by looking at the interconnected identity graph that is semantically associated.</p>

                  <p>Annotation of artefacts facilitates a social behaviour in that it is a collaborative effort: some actors create primary resources while others create associations between those resources, add new information, or extend existing information.

                  <p>A Web Annotation can be created to associate a node or a selection with a particular user motivation. The annotation can be registered and stored as a unit of information at actor's <a href="#profile-storage">storage</a>, <a href="#profile-index">type index location</a>, <a href="#profile-outbox">outbox</a>, or article's <a href="#subject-annotation-service">annotation service</a>. The users can provide a text note for their annotations, assign a <a href="#license">license</a>, as well as designate an <a href="#subject-inbox">inbox</a> for their annotation, so that it can receive its own notifications. The Table on WA motivations includes the method applied, location of the annotation, and associated notification.</p>

                  <p>Once an annotation is created and has a dereferenceable HTTP URI (subject to access control rules), a notification can be sent to the inbox of the target resource about the annotation if any part of an article advertises an LDN inbox. Depending on the motivation of the annotation, the notification is modelled with the <cite>Activity vocabulary</cite> eg. the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-create">Create</a> activity (<code>as:Create</code>), to indicate that the actor has created the object.</p>

                  <p>In order to discover and view previously created annotations associated with an article, dokieli follows LDN's discovery mechanism for notifications about annotations, and then subsequently fetches the annotations in order to display them in context of their target selector.</p>

                  <p id="aak-use-cases">In 2016, the <cite><a href="https://hypothes.is/annotating-all-knowledge/">Annotating All Knowledge Coalition</a></cite> derived user stories based on the notion of what open annotation can enable. Below is a description of how dokieli realises the user stories <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190122121041/https://web.hypothes.is/blog/a-coalition-of-scholarly-annotators/#selector(type=XPathSelector,value=%2Fhtml%2Fbody%2Fdiv%5B4%5D%2Fmain%2Fdiv%2Fsection%2Farticle%2Fdiv%5B2%5D%2Ful%5B1%5D)">derived from</a> <cite><a data-versiondate="2019-01-22T12:10:41Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20190122121041/https://web.hypothes.is/blog/a-coalition-of-scholarly-annotators/" href="https://hypothes.is/blog/a-coalition-of-scholarly-annotators/">A Coalition for Scholarly Annotation</a></cite>. The term <q>publisher</q> that is used in these user stories usually refer to an entity that is other than the creators of the content. Whereas in dokieli, a <q>publisher</q> is <em>any</em> actor capable of triggering the registration of resources and having their content potentially accessible to anyone.</p>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Activities</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>The mechanism for personal identities, social graphs, and self-publishing articles and annotations enables a new layer of decentralised interactions. Here I describe how actors can discover units of information created or annotated in response to Web resources (like articles) by their social network without intermediaries (which includes the authors of the article or the features supported by the server it is published at). This scenario expands on <em>identity A knows identity B</em>, and <em>identity B has a <a href="#profile-knows-profile-storage">storage</a> or <a href="#profile-knows-profile-outbox">outbox</a></em> as declared in <a href="#linking-the-decentralised-information-space">Linking the Decentralised Information Space</a>.</p>

                  <p>As each unit of information can be independently published and made accessible by an actor, one way to discover the information is by determining the relation between their WebID and the location of their collection of artefacts eg. under their personal storage (<code>pim:storage</code>) or activity outbox (<code>as:outbox</code>). The second connection between the actor that is interested in discovering such information and the actors which created them (<code>foaf:knows</code>). Hence, we are able to discover the reactions (like replies, comments, approvals, questioning, or annotations in general) made by the members of an actor's social graph.</p>

                  <p>In order to realise this scenario, the required components are as follows:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Actor A wants to read annotations or activities around a unit of information.</li>
                    <li>Actor A knows actor B.</li>
                    <li>Actor B has a collection of artefacts.</li>
                    <li>Actor A has read access to Actor B's activity collection.</li>
                    <li>Actor A's application associates the unit of interest with actor B's annotation or activity.</li>
                    <li>Actor A's application displays the annotation in context of the unit of information.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>As these components are solely based on interoperable standards, any conforming application is able to interact with, and perhaps more importantly, is not subject to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">vendor lock-in</a>.</p>

                  <p>This scenario is realised in dokieli, and works as a single-page application or via the Web Extension. The Web Extension enables a new dimension to discovering and consuming independently published activities in that, a user can navigate to any HTTP URL and potentially discover and interact with annotations made by the members of their network. Thereby, a layer of decentralised and linked research space can exist independently, where any Web resource, perhaps typically an article, can be incorporated into the social or research discourse.</p>

                  <p>As each annotation (or unit of information) can have its own inbox, subsequent interactions with the annotation can be both stored at the annotator's storage and notified at the advertised inbox. This further decouples the components required to publish and consume content on the Web in an interoperable way. The decentralised activities in dokieli demonstrates the utility of independent publishing, semantic relations, as well as extensibility of structured Web objects.</p>

                  <p>A key aspect of the Social Web is sharing our creations and interests with the others. After (optionally) authenticating with a WebID, dokieli documents can be shared with contacts, which are discovered from the user’s WebID profile. Contacts whose profiles advertise an LDN Inbox will receive a notification of the share. The notification is modelled with the Activity vocabulary, eg. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-announce">Announce</a>, to indicate that the actor is calling the target's attention to the object. Recipients can use any LDN-compatible application to view the notification, without needing to have ever used dokieli before.</p>

                  <p id="contextual-citations"><strong>Contextual Citations</strong>: One way to create a citation in dokieli is by authors selecting a node or a text fragment of interest in their document, and then inserting the URI of the resource to be linked to, as well as a specifying the type of semantic link between them in a specific or general way using the classifications available from the CiTO ontology eg. using <q>agrees with</q>, <q>confirms</q>, <q class="highlight-cites-as-evidence">cites as evidence</q>. The input for the cited entity can be any HTTP URI, DOI string, or <abbr title="International Standard Serial Number">ISSN</abbr> string, and when resolved from a corresponding HTTP URL, the content in RDF is used towards constructing the citation. dokieli takes the input target URI, and retrieves data (like title, authors) expressed in RDF in the linked document, integrates the statement expressed in RDF (eg. figure <a href="#example-cites-as-evidence">cites as evidence</a>) in context of the content, and adds a scientific endnote reference including the retrieved information. As a citation results in the assigning an HTTP URI for the citing entity, it can be further semantically annotated by the actor.</p>

                  <p id="robust-citations"><strong>Robust Citations</strong>: In order to preserve the context of the citation as well as taking content-drift and link-rot into account, first a snapshot of the cited entity's URI is created at the <cite>Internet Archive</cite>, and then both the archived URI and its datetime stamp is incorporated to the referencing hyperlink - the original citation resource.</p>

                  <p id="notifying-cited-entity"><strong>Notifying Cited Entity</strong>: Once a citation is made through the dokieli user interface, dokieli proceeds to check if the cited article advertises its own LDN inbox, and if so, sends a notification to indicate the citation function. This notification serves as an announcement for the back-reference, ie. being informed that a citation was made and thus creating discoverable <em>bi-directional linking</em> between the units of information. With the help of an inbox consumer, like dokieli, the cited article can also inform the reader about the back-references out there on the Web.</p>

                  <p id="citation-registrations"><strong>Registrations</strong>: The citation activity results in the registering HTTP URIs for the citing resource, archived snapshot, and the notification resource.</p>

                  <p>It is possible to use dokieli's create operations as a composite to fulfill social and scholarly activities. One common scenario includes soliciting reviews, reviewing, announcement of the review, and final decisions made by community members. Combining <a href="#creating-resources">creating resources</a>, <a href="#annotations">annotations</a> and <a href="#sharing-resources">sharing resources</a> in dokieli is as follows:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Actor A publishes their article at preferred location.</li>
                    <li>Actor A sends Actor B a notification requesting a review of their article.</li>
                    <li>Actor B creates a derived copy of Actor A's article at their preferred location. The derived resource optionally includes its own inbox and annotation service.</li>
                    <li>Actor B reviews and annotates the derived resource by storing their annotations at preferred location. Notifications are sent to the inbox about the annotation.</li>
                    <li>Actor B archives their derived copy with annotations.</li>
                    <li>Actor B sends Actor A a notification sharing the location of the annotated resource.</li>
                    <li>Actor A visits Actor B's derived resource and discovers the review and annotations.</li>
                    <li>Actor B sends a notification to a community inbox that is dedicated to monitor scholarly activities about their review and annotations so that it can be discovered by other actors.</li>
                    <li>Actor C discovers Actor B's review through the community inbox.</li>
                  </ul>

                  </figure>

                  <p>This particular scenario shows that it is possible for each actor to create and control resources, including articles, annotations, and notifications at their PDS or preferred locations. It is one way to combine standards-compliant mechanisms meanwhile actors can shape their content, self-publish, as well as share their works with other actors and services. In essence, the registration, certification, awareness, and archiving functions in scholarly communication are fulfilled in this scenario without a central authority.</p>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Privacy Considerations</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>Creating awareness and enabling actors to protect their data privacy is essential to fostering user's trust in the systems they use. The adoption of standards and practices with different <a href="#degree-of-control">degrees of control</a> can yield different privacy measures. In the decentralised and interoperable environment that dokieli operates in, there are a number of challenges and approaches. I discuss user privacy, data privacy, preferred proxy, and private activities below. The terms <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, and <q>pseudonymity</q> follow the definitions from <cite><a data-versiondate="2019-01-28T12:06:31Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20190128120631/http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf" href="http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf">A terminology for talking about privacy by data minimization: Anonymity, Unlinkability, Undetectability, Unobservability, Pseudonymity, and Identity Management</a></cite>, Pfitzmann, 2010.</p>

                  <p id="user-privacy"><strong>User Privacy</strong>: dokieli acts as a conduit to perform read-write operations against <abbr title="Personal Data Store">PDS</abbr>. As the rules for read-write operations are set by servers, dokieli does not require the creation of user accounts at any server, in order to interact with the server's resources. Where applicable, actors can participate by maintaining their <em>anonymity</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, or can choose to identify themselves to dokieli by using their preferred <a href="#personal-identities">personal identities</a>, without necessarily disclosing "real" information. Actors authenticate against the servers they prefer in order to perform access-controlled actions. It is possible for the environment in which dokieli operates in to transmit device, machine, or browser fingerprint, thereby potentially risking <em>unlinkability</em> - however, they are outside the control and scope of dokieli.</p>

                  <p id="data-privacy"><strong>Data Privacy</strong>: With respect to data privacy, actors can exercise their autonomy through the use of PDS for their profiles, articles, annotations, and notifications. As a <a href="#pds-expectation">PDS can provide</a> us with the means to safeguard data, dokieli as a clientside application enables actors to perform <a href="#read-write-linked-data">read-write Linked Data</a> operations where they prefer under their own conditions. With the help of access controls, a PDS that dokieli communicates with can potentially fulfill all minimizations - <q>anonymity</q>, <q>unlinkability</q>, <q>undetectability</q>, <q>unobservability</q>, <q>pseudonymity</q> - possibly with the exception of the domain name and IP that the PDS operates from.</p>

                  <p id="preferred-proxy"><strong>Preferred Proxy</strong>: A proxy acts as an intermediary between the clientside application and the destination server. This is useful in a number of scenarios for dokieli, such as getting around <a href="#mixed-content">Mixed Content</a> issues, absence of <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a></cite> (<abbr title="Cross-Origin Resource Sharing">CORS</abbr>) support, as well as concealing the identity of the actor, fulfilling <em>anonymity</em>, <em>unlinkability</em>, <em>pseudonymity</em>, when making requests to a target server. An actor's preferred proxy can be determined by checking their WebID Profile description for the <code>solid:preferredProxy</code> relation, and if found, dokieli can use it to route requests when needed. Alternatively, a built-in (but user configurable) proxy location in dokieli is used.</p>

                  <p id="private-activities"><strong>Private Activities</strong>: The ability for actors to create and discover <a href="#activities">activities</a> made within their social network without going through intermediaries, makes it possible to isolate units of information that is both access-controlled and invisible (or be unknown) to third-parties. These class of interactions in dokieli is aligned with the notion of <em>undetectability</em> and <em>unobservability</em>.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>dokieli is a clientside application that uses the user-agent to interact with server applications. It has two deployment approaches including the same set of features: <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single-page application</a></cite> and <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension">Web browser extension</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p id="single-page-application">dokieli’s presentational and behavioural code layers can be included in Web "pages" in order to trigger them as active single-page applications. It is a smart client that allows different kinds of articles eg. academic, blog posts, news, to be authored and annotated from within Web browsers, without necessarily having them deployed from a server, ie. it can be used offline or on localhost. dokieli internally handles its content and structural and semantic representation based on user’s actions and available information. Articles, profiles and their contact information, notifications, annotations with different motivations, for instance, can be read and written ubiquitously to any Web space with supporting HTTP methods and access control mechanisms.</p>

                  <p id="web-browser-extension">The Web browser extension is a thin wrapper around dokieli’s core code in order to embed itself in any HTML-based Web page on the Web. It inherits all of the features of a single-page application. While HTML based documents on the Web vary in their quality, dokieli’s write operations generate HTML+RDFa. One of the utilities for the extension is to have a consistent interface for annotating node or text selections on a Web resource, building structured citations, creating derivations of Web resources as well as sharing document fragments with ones contacts via notifications, without having a service dependency or being limited by the Web page’s UI.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>In <cite><a data-versiondate="2018-12-28T11:36:36Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20181228113636/http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2011/JWS_SemanticContentAuthoring/public.pdf" href="http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2011/JWS_SemanticContentAuthoring/public.pdf">User Interfaces for Semantic Authoring of Textual Content: A Systematic Literature Review</a></cite>, Khalili, 2011, provide an analysis on approaches for <q>Semantic Content Authoring</q> (<abbr title="Semantic Content Authoring">SCA</abbr>), which is defined as <q>a tool-supported manual composition process aiming at the creation of semantic documents. With an ontology and a user interface appropriate for the type of content, semantic authoring can be easier than traditional composition of content and the resulting content can be of higher quality.</q> The article proposes a set of <q>quality attributes</q> - as non-functional requirements - to evaluate the performance of SCA systems: usability, customizability, generalizability, collaboration, portability, accessibility, proactivity, automation, evolvability, interoperability, and scalability. Based on the starting point of the authoring process, the authors distinguish the approaches, and generally categorised as <q>bottom-up</q> (lifting unstructured content to a semantic level) or <q>top-down</q> (semantic representations from the beginning requiring users with the knowledge of the domain), and sometimes a hybrid of the two. A survey of tools are presented (in article's Table 3) covering different types of users, expected domain knowledge, and authoring approach. The article also discusses <cite>Research and Technology Challenges</cite> and identifies a gap in addressing <q>accessibility</q>, <q>handling complexity in UIs</q>, <q>formal and systematic methods for user interface evaluation</q>, <q>heuristic evaluation</q>, <q>support of crowdsourcing</q>, UIs for ubiquitous devices.</p>

              <p>The scope of SCA is relevant because it covers some of the aspects of dokieli that can be examined. Hence, I use the structure of the table of results for SCA systems and include a dataset about <a href="#quality-attributes-dokieli">dokieli's quality attributes</a>:</p>

              <p>dokieli is composed of use cases that are realised through a collection of open Web standards. I contend that dokieli is a <a href="decentralising-scholarly-communication#socially-aware-read-write-linked-data">socially-aware read-write Linked Data</a> application. It demonstrates how decentralised units of communication can be co-created and used by actors and applications.</p>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Web Publishing Systems</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>Throughout this article I have highlighted the environment that the AWWW enables with the goal of fostering a universally accessible and interoperable information space. I have also looked at the ongoing initiatives towards the decoupling of functions in scientific communication. Here I reuse some of these notions to situate dokieli with some existing work that can be (subjectively) <em>considered as representative</em> for different areas in <q>Web publishing</q>. There is plethora of examples for centralised and decentralised systems on the Web. Some of the authoring and publishing systems already fulfill some aspects of decentralised systems which operate over HTTP. I focus on degree of control with respect to applications, data and identity, privacy, accessibility, and interoperability, as well as approximating where in the <a href="#client-server-spectrum">client-server spectrum</a> (tightly or loosely coupled) in which a system generally falls under.</p>

                  <p id="gmtf">Currently, <cite><a href="https://docs.google.com/" rel="cito:discusses">Google Docs</a></cite>, <cite><a href="https://medium.com/" rel="cito:discusses">Medium</a></cite>, <cite><a href="https://twitter.com/" rel="cito:discusses">Twitter</a></cite>, <cite><a href="https://facebook.com/" rel="cito:discusses">Facebook</a></cite> are examples of well-known Web applications for collaborative creation and publication of content. Users create accounts on these systems to perform access controlled read-write operations on data stored on the same server. These kind of systems allow users to authenticate with their identity provider from preconfigured authorities, as well providing their own accounts on the system. Each service generally has a custom API and vocabulary that a trusted client application (normally hosted on the same server) uses to interact with the server in order to perform CRUD operations through the user interface. They are categorically a client-server that is <a href="#client-server-tightly-coupled">tightly coupled</a>.</p>

                  <p id="wordpress"><cite><a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="cito:discusses">WordPress</a></cite> is a free and open-source client-server application for article publication which can be self-hosted on a server controlled by the user. Users may optionally sign-in with their WordPress accounts to leave comments on others’ articles where they are stored by the hosting site.</p>

                  <p id="mediawiki"><cite><a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/" rel="cito:discusses">MediaWiki</a></cite> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki software</a> for collaborative content creation, structuring, and modification, most well known for its use by <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></cite>. It runs as a service with a server and a frontend client application in the Web browser. Users create accounts per service in order to further control the frontend to perform CRUD operations. Content can be licensed, and changes are versioned with HTTP URIs. Human-readable content is available in HTML, and considered to be accessible and archive-friendly. Data into the system can flow in from <cite><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a></cite>, a storage for structured data - expressed and dereferenceable as RDF with a SPARQL query service - used by Wikimedia projects.</p>

                  <p id="hypothes.is"><cite><a href="https://hypothes.is/" rel="cito:discusses">Hypothes.is</a></cite> has a server and client application that makes it possible for users to leave annotations on different types of documents on the Web using either a browser extension, proxy service, or including its JavaScript library in HTML documents. Annotations may be private, public, or for a group, and can be threaded to form conversations around a piece of content. Each instance of a client application is preconfigured to use its own API endpoint against a particular server to perform CRUD operations, such as creating and finding annotations and related data. Actors use accounts hosted on the server or can be configured to use their own identity provider eg. hypothes.is, orcid.org. Annotations can be self-hosted, however different servers do not federate. The HTML representations of annotations requires JavaScript to be available and enabled on the user-agent in order to look up and fetch the annotation's contents in JSON from its API and update the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>. The annotation URLs, proxy, and the browser extension uses the <cite><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a></cite> (<abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr>) tracking service per active URL. On active URLs, the client application by default makes API calls to the Hypothes.is server to check for annotations. On-demand archiving services like the Internet Archive are currently unable to properly archive an annotation's contents. It is possible to fetch an annotation that is represented with the WA Data Model from a server, however the annotation is not machine-discoverable ie. other applications will need to be uniquely configured with Hypothes.is's annotation URL template in order to acquire a JSON-LD representation.</p>

                  <p>One common architectural aspect to these systems is that while they have some characteristics of <a href="#client-server-loosely-coupled">loosely coupled</a> system, the server is expected to work with a designated client application. For instance, they require account creation and data storage with respect to an appointed centralised service. In essence, the user interface is restricted to communicate with a particular service endpoint, as well as an authority that governs all actor identities and the data they have produced. They allow multiple participants to annotate and hold discussions around the primary content; users must access their accounts to be notified of updates to conversations, and data from both the main content and related discussion is confined to the service which was used to create it. The data formats and schemas are consistent across storage instances in that it is possible to migrate data from one location to another using the same server application, storage mechanism and data schema. Archivability of Web resources varies and their access being at the discretion of server owners.</p>

                  <p id="libreoffice-online"><cite><a href="https://github.com/libreoffice/online" rel="cito:discusses">LibreOffice Online</a></cite>'s <cite>Writer</cite>, for example, allows collaborative editing of office documents from the Web browser. Content can be stored under different CMSs in the cloud. The document’s interface consists of image tiles which are sent from the server and rendered in the browser. However, it hardly provides accessibility, rich interlinking and annotations.</p>

The client application was integrated into Amaya where it was able to store and recall annotations locally or from a remote annotation server, with the expectation of an access controlled server using the standard HTTP authentication mechanisms. Annotea annotations independent Web resources. Annotea has a <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html">protocol</a></cite> that specifies the CRUD operations for servers and clients, and enables different applications to be built. Annotea in Amaya for instance allowed the user to specify the URI of an annotation server. In order to reference target resources, annotations used <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-element/">XML Pointer Language</a></cite> (<abbr title="XML Pointer Language">XPointer</abbr>) to specify the part of HTML or XML-based documents that the annotation was in context of. Annotea laid out a path for subsequent systems, influencing <cite><a href="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/">Open Annotation Data Model</a></cite> which later evolved into the WA Data Model.</p>

                  <hr />

                  <p id="dokieli-hypothesis">A tentative view of the interoperability between Hypothes.is and dokieli is as follows. The client applications Hypothes.is and dokieli are non-conflicting in that when used in the same content or context, each can still be used on its own. A Hypothes.is client application can search and fetch annotations from an associated server using the Hypothes.is API, and render them on the target resource. dokieli can discover the WA annotation service of a Web resource, fetch annotations from servers conforming to the WAP and LDP, and render them on the target resource. Additional data about the annotation can be created and reused in both applications. A Hypothes.is client application can authenticate with a particular server using OAuth. Actors with WebID in dokieli can authenticate with servers supporting WebID-TLS and WebID-OIDC. Both can create annotations given authorization. Hypothes.is application can extend and direct annotations to a community group using the same server. dokieli triggers content negotiation with servers to determine preferred RDF serialization of Web Annotation and profile. The Hypothes.is client can only fetch annotations from a corresponding Hypothes.is server. dokieli can only fetch annotations from servers implementing LDP or WAP. Putting the method of fetching an annotation resource aside, it is possible for either client application to render an annotation serialized as JSON-LD that is created by the other application.</p>

                  <p>Existing server and client applications in particular to authoring and publishing are complex systems in that while they adhere or adopt some aspects of open Web specifications, they also include proprietary designs. Such systems also have varying characteristics of centralisation and decentralisation, hence, while some aspects are interoperable, other areas require post facto efforts to interop.</p>

                  <p>The tools which provide good collaborative editing user-interfaces appear to do so at the expense of data ownership and interoperability; those which promote creation and publication of data in open reusable formats are lacking facilities for linking discourse and conversation to concepts published. Decentralised creations also mean that each author can choose their own semantics eg. their own vocabulary to annotate using the RDF language, and then such decentralised documents can link to each other and their schemas can also be mapped to each other, whereas in centralised systems this is (if they support structured semantics at all) often prescribed, either technically enforced, or encouraged by social convention.</p>

                  <p>Future work can examine how additional features can be realised on top of existing Web standards, or where more development is required. Real-time collaborative editing is often realised with centralised communication (even though some peer to peer alternatives exist). Services like top-down annotations or automated entity marking can improve the discoverability of a publication, yet the question of how to offer these without being tied to certain servers as well as Web identities served from fixed servers needs further work.</p>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Effects and Artefacts of dokieli</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>dokieli shows it is possible to build a social machine wherein people interact with each other without the need of centralised coordination. Users can choose storage space for their content independently of the applications with which they edit and view that content. Documents are connected statically through links and dynamically through Linked Data Notifications. This is a proof for the viability of a social and decentralised authoring and annotation environment based on Web standards. dokieli happens to be one application that demonstrates the potentials of decentralised notifications and annotations. The information it creates does not result in a vendor lock-in, as other applications are able to reuse them - given agreement on using open Web standards.</p>

                  <p>On the other hand, dokieli’s use of standards shows that dokieli itself is only one means to an end: once the document has been created, it lives on independently. The social machine consists of people and documents, connected by Web standards, with dokieli acting as just one possible catalyst. Different Web applications can incorporate any of dokieli’s functions and implement the principles to varying extent. Since the data is decoupled from the application, we avoid the <em>walled garden</em> problem of current social platforms today, as well as various forms of vendor lock-in with some applications, even if they are are operating in a loosely coupled environment. In essence, it is possible to swap dokieli with another client application and still communicate with any standards-compliant server. This is one of the key steps to liberating actors to create and share without setting burdens on URI, data and application control.</p>

                  <p>A couple of important sociotechnical challenges remain, and implications on autonomy. Resources might want to indicate in a granular way which actions they support or encourage, such as assessments, bookmarking, or sharing, and perhaps conditions about which notifications should be sent when any of these events take place. In order to encourage positive behaviour, we might want ways to provide moderation, and solutions to prevent harassment and abuse. Closely related is the issue of identity, pseudonymity and anonymity, and its relation with trust and verification. There are also social implications of dokieli's Web browser extension and social graph. For instance, the ability of annotating and sharing information even if the primary article does not have an inbox or an annotation service. There is no administrator that oversees everything, but that each actor has control privileges to what they are given. Having the ability to annotate anything and stored at a preferred location enables actor autonomy. This can be contrasted with annotation systems that may restricts annotations being created with particular targets or annotations having particular information in its body.</p>

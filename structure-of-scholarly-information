              <p>Given that global strategic research is influenced by policies and industry, we acknowledge that different <em>information spaces</em> can be created by an ensemble of units of information. Such information spaces would serve to facilitate knowledge exchange in the scientific communication market. In this section, we use the LR design principles to materialise and analyse a particular configuration of an information space.</p>

              <p>Figure X depicts a typical high-level interplay between the <em>actors</em> and the <em>content</em> forces, and their functions (registration, awareness, certification, archive) in scholarly communication.</p>

              <p>Here authors create research literature in reply to a call for contributions; reviewers provide feedback on the research results; individuals annotate and re-share the literature; editors filter and assemble a collection of work; archives are notified about the research.</p>

              <p>Given that the <em>applicability</em> is an external force, and that the <em>certification</em> function is applied, eg. peer review, editors' filters, in this, we assume that the demand of applicability of science and technology is part of this information space. We take for granted that each unit of information can independently exist and be accessible for humans and machines from anywhere on the Web, the presence of the <em>accessibility</em> force is active in this information space.</p>

Rough coverage:
* Expand literature on HTML patterns
* RDFa editors (what can/do they produce)
* literature review for UI (reuse dokieli-rww and maybe from linked-research-scholarly-communication)
* Expand on the why we are focusing on the narrative here - documents vs datasets - this is a parallel for humans and machines - document Web was mostly for humans and now with LD web.. connect with interpretable/interactive
** Implementation of embedding prose semantics with dokieli (evaluation).
** argumentation graph
** Citations (pulling and reusing external data)
** URIs for prose, concepts, ideas, research sections as deemed important by authors.

* Embedding data (top-down / bottom-up)

* Web technologies for authoring, self-publishing; progressive enhancement, alternative presentations, exposing data along with "papers"

* Multimodal active documents
* Embedding statistical and experimental data, and views

<p>The structure of a scholarly journal article has been mostly conserved during the evolution of scientific communication. Articles include a sequence of sections, usually an abstract; introduction and background relevant to earlier work; methods used to justify experiments; research results; discussion and conclusions; and list of references.</p>

              <p>Researchers exchange units of communication like scientific literature, annotation, datasets, workflows, argumentation, provenance, citation, and software. Knowledge may be represented or presented dynamically, or as a compilation of various independent units (compound). Semantic structure may be embedded in narrative or prose-based scholarly communication as well as used to enhance non-narrative units like experimental results or datasets. Narrative and non-narrative units may in turn include or refer to each other.</p>

              <p>This section covers semantic structure of the narrative aspects scholarly communication in particular. This can enhance <em>both</em> human- and machine-readability of information. Note also that we are interested here in structured representations of units irrespective of how they are produced.</p>

              <p>Non-narrative units can also be semantically marked up to enable easier reuse and interpretation; this is covered in more detail in <cite><a href="interactive-linked-statistics">Interactive Linked Statistics</a></cite>.</p>

                    <dd>Declarative programming is a style of building the structure and expressing the semantics of programs, ie. <em>what</em> it should accomplish. The imperative programming style on the other hand is about <em>how</em> the program should execute and change the program state. The declarative approach tends to be short, easy to understand, independent of implementation, less likely to contain errors as well as to easily correct, and tractable. For example, many domain-specific markup languages, such as HTML and XML family (XSLT, SVG, MathML), and CSS are declarative. HTML simply tells the consuming agent - like a Web browser - what should appear as part of a Webapage. HTML's readability and ease of interpretation played a role in its adoption - anyone that wanted to express some information in a Webpage can "view source" to learn without any further steps.</dd>

                    <dt id="rdf-as-the-language">RDF as the language</dt>
                    <dd>
                      <p>HTML is the predominant means to publish information on the Web. While this is sufficient to cover various use cases in the scholarly information space, it is limited in the sense that the granularity of machine-readable content is based on the classic hypertext model, ie. ultimately a relationship with loose semantics between documents or their parts. It is considered to be limited in terms of capturing domain-specific knowledge. This is in contrast to using RDF as the language to communicate knowledge about arbitrary things at different levels of abstraction. We consider the application of the RDF <em>language</em> is the fundamental requirement since atomic statements about scientific information and scholarly activities can be expressed, as well as each component of a statement being universally identifiable. The language enables the information to be serialised using different syntaxes eg. HTML+RDFa, Turtle. Perhaps most importantly, the underlying data is intended to be manipulated as a <em>graph</em> of things, where its syntactical representations remaining isomorphic across serialisations.</p>

                    <dt id="human-and-machine-interpretable-units">Human and machine-interpretable units</dt>
                    <dd>
                      <p>As indicated earlier, the high-level units of communication that we are examining are primarily in the form of prose which may be accompanied with supplemental (meta)data. With this premise, we emphasise on the point that the underlying information is intended for <em>both</em> humans and machines, where each can create and interact with the information through applicable and desired interfaces.</p>

                      <p id="content-negotiation-as-optimisation">The HTTP <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.4">Content Negotiation</a></cite> mechanism can be used to serve a possible representation of a resource that the client prefers from a URI. The decision algorithm may be based on different dimensions of content negotiation, eg. media type, character set, encoding, language, time. All things equal, here we consider having simplicity in the design as a desired quality for a server requirement, in order to make data available for the purpose of read-write operations that a client can perform. For instance, to what extent can we serve a resource representation "as is" without having to perform media type conversions in order to satisfy both human and machine consumers?</p>

                      <p id="rdfa">From the available RDF syntaxes, this line of reasoning brings us to encapsulating information using <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/">RDFa 1.1</a></cite> - attribute-level extension - inside host languages like (X)HTML, and various XML-family languages eg. SVG, MathML. What makes <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-in-html/">RDFa in HTML</a></cite>, for instance, an attractive combination is that it maps patterns in RDF which is ideal for enhanced machine control, while retaining the same document that is interpretable by humans. Essentially, interoperable information exchange and reuse by machines is intended to work over the RDF graph that is expressed through RDFa. Here HTML merely acts as the container to encapsulate the underlying information and to offer presentations and interactions (in regardless of the RDF syntax embedded in HTML). RDFa specifies only a syntax and allows independently defined specifications (like vocabularies) to be used. Existing HTTP servers can virtually serve HTML content without additional server or client-side modules or application logic. Ergo, RDFa in HTML manifests a low barrier to make human and machine-interpretable information available from a single URL. The W3C TAG Finding <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/selfDescribingDocuments">The Self-Describing Web</a></cite> also posits RDFa in HTML as a good practice: <q cite="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/selfDescribingDocuments.html#UsingRDFa">To integrate HTML information into the self-describing Semantic Web, use RDFa.</q></p>

                          <p>The initial motivation and development on encoding <q>RDF in HTML</q> started in the late 1990s and continued into early 2000, and eventually became the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/rdf-a.html">RDF/A Syntax</a></cite> - currently known as RDFa - in 2004. The goal was to express RDF by using markup language's attribute mechanism on existing content so that existing documents can be enhanced to be more machine-readable while retaining its human-readable nature. There has been a number of <cite><a data-versiondate="2018-04-07T08:20:30Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20180407082030/http://infomesh.net/2002/rdfinhtml/" href="http://infomesh.net/2002/rdfinhtml/">RDF in HTML: Approaches</a></cite> which helped shape the initial version of RDFa, the surviving approach i) retained the expressiveness of the RDF language, and extending host languages (like HTML, SVG, MathML) through common attributes as necessary, ii) was aligned with the original vision of the Web, iii) was built through consensus through an open Web standards body like the W3C - as opposed to forks which eventually broke under the management of chat clubs.</p>

                      <p id="why-rdfa">Information in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#in-html">Turtle</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#embedding-json-ld-in-html-documents">JSON-LD</a> can be embedded in HTML documents within the <code>script</code> tags, and remain hidden from native HTML interfaces for human view. Their processing rules On the other hand, RDFa can be embedded on any tag, and so all human-visible content in HTML can be complimented with machine-readable counterparts in the same context node. This is optimal in avoiding data duplication in the same document which happens to be the case with the other serialisations in RDF, as well as avoiding any further intervention to synchronise data across different nodes. Having a single, unambiguous, and authoritative representation of the information as human-visible and marked as RDFa conforms to the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">Don't Repeat Yourself</a></cite> (<abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>) principle. It is efficient in that it has no dependency on JavaScript, external or third-party applications to make the hidden machine-readable content be consumable from a human user interface - whereas HTML based user-agents can be expected to conform to <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html">user interaction</a></cite> <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html">loading Web pages</a></cite> specification. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_web_browser">text-based web browsers</a> can access and allow interactions with documents. RDFa in HTML is all around a simple but effective design pattern that is able to serve both humans and machines without additional parts or machinery. With all things equal, having all content in HTML is optimal for Web-based archives, thereby meeting the <em>archival</em> and <em>awareness</em> functions to fullest degree.</p>

                      <p>Having the canonical representation for articles, annotations, and notifications in HTML+RDFa, still leaves the servers, if so desired, to provide alternative serialisations, eg. Turtle, and JSON-LD, depending on the content negotiation with clients. Articles are represented in HTML+RDFa so that information is usable by both humans and machine consumers while maintaining lowest requirements for publishing, eg. a single URL with full content in HTML+RDFa can be accessible from any HTTP server. No additional requirements necessary from clients (eg. JavaScript support and enabled) or servers (eg. additional RDF based content negotiation).</p>

Ultimately, the unit of communication represented in HTML+RDFa can be accessible - readable - for both humans and machines without requiring any CSS or JavaScript. This approach is considered to cover the base requirement of making the content available with lowest server requirements, ie. practically, today any HTTP server that can serve HTML and a client that can consume HTML.</p>

                    <dd>
                      <p>HTML has several <cite><a href="http://w3c.github.io/html/single-page.html#design-notes-extensibility">extensibility mechanisms</a></cite>, eg. <code>class</code>, <code>data-*</code>, <code>rel</code> attributes, and <code>meta</code>, <code>script</code> elements to support vendor-neutral markup patterns. In addition to HTML's <cite><a href="http://w3c.github.io/html/infrastructure.html#infrastructure">common infrastructure</a></cite>, it is possible for documents to signal formal grammars, eg. HTML profiles and XML schemas, to announce the structure of documents such that the machine-processing instructions are well-defined; predetermined and fixed. In practice, grammars are used to help extract markup patterns according to specified definitions. Although <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/DroppedAttributeProfile">profiles are no longer supported in HTML5</a>, they were originally intended to assign additional meaning that would otherwise remain local (private) to the document. For instance, <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/grddl/">Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages</a></cite> (<abbr title="Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages">GRDDL</abbr>) provided a way for custom <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt/">XSL Transformations</a></cite> (<abbr title="XSL Transformations">XSLT</abbr>) to handle out-of-band transformation workflows, and to interpret the structure and semantics in the original document.</p>

                      <p>While HTML markup with formal grammars has the quality of being efficient for cooperating systems, it comes at the cost of wider interoperability. That is, if an application is designed to <em>only</em> work with a particular flavour or subset of HTML, then it would not be able to work with arbitrary HTML documents on the Web. Hence, having profiles or grammars in and itself not an issue, however its <em>effects</em> are likely to be that they are less interoperable than they can be. This is in contrast to applications safely ignoring information patterns they do not understand or interested in using, even if they have their preferred internal grammars or HTML templates. From the consuming side, if the application's information <em>reuse</em> is dependent on HTML a specific schema or tree structure, effectively locks the application into coping with those patterns, and ultimately less flexible about handling expressions that the application is unfamiliar with. The effect is a constrained or a closed information system.</p>

                <h3 property="schema:name">Vocabularies</h3>
                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>Here we describe a wide range of well-known Semantic Web vocabularies that can be used to model and describe units of communication. It is not intended to be an exhaustive list but to provide an overview on the kind of things that could be potentially described, anywhere from publishing articles, scholarly activities, to datasets holding scientific measurements.</p>

                  <p><strong>General purpose</strong>: <cite><a href="http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMI Metadata Terms</a></cite> is used to describe digital and physical resources along with metadata on provenance and rights. <cite><a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a></cite> is composed of a common set of schemas that occurs in Web pages. These vocabularies are widely used on the Web and are generally domain agnostic, making them suitable to describe document-level concepts with respect to scholarly units.</p>

                  <p><strong>Publishing and referencing</strong>: <cite><a href="http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/">Bibliographic Ontology Specification</a></cite> and <cite><a href="http://purl.org/spar">Semantic Publishing and Referencing Ontologies</a></cite> (<abbr title="Semantic Publishing and Referencing Ontologies">SPAR</abbr>) cover a wide range of concepts in the publishing domain while being agnostic about the types of content, eg. <q>document description, bibliographic resource identifiers, types of citations and related contexts, bibliographic references, document parts and status, agents' roles and contributions, bibliometric data and workflow processes</q>.</p>

                  <p><strong>Knowledge Organisation</strong>: <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/">Simple Knowledge Organization System</a></cite> (<abbr title="Simple Knowledge Organization System">SKOS</abbr>) defines a common data model for structures like thesauri, taxonomies, classification schemes and subject heading systems in library and information sciences. SKOS is suitable to bridge different scientific communities to organise concepts by providing definitions, links, and possible mappings across collections.</p>

                  <p><strong>Participation</strong>: Actors are integral to social Web activities and the four functions of scholarly communication. Generally speaking, agent - human or machine - profiles can be described with the <cite><a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">Friend of a Friend</a></cite> (<abbr title="Friend of a Friend">FOAF</abbr>) vocabulary to have a combination of what or who they are, what they have created, who they know, their memberships, and so forth. <cite><a href="http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/">SIOC Core Ontology Specification</a></cite> provides concepts to describe information from online communities like weblogs, message boards, wikis, etc., as well as connections between their content items. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/">Activity Vocabulary</a></cite> provides specific activity structures and types for objects and links (eg. article, event, place, mention), actors (eg. application, group, person, service) and for past, current or future social activities (eg. announce, create, like, invite, question). While the core vocabulary covers a wide range of activities, it can be extended to cover domain-specific scientific activities. The <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/">Web Annotation Vocabulary</a></cite> underpins the annotation model and is used to express information about a set of connected resources, typically conveying some sort of a relationship where the <q>body</q> of a resource is about the <q>target</q> resource. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-html/">Embedding Web Annotations in HTML</a></cite> describes and illustrates potential approaches for including annotations within HTML documents using current specifications like RDFa or JSON-LD. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/">Selectors and States</a> describes the use of annotation Selectors as URI fragment identifiers relying on the formal specification and the semantics in the data model. Any resources can advertise a location where it can receive <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> for social activities eg. invitation to review an article, annotation being created. We describe LDN in detail later serving as one of the foundational components towards a decentralised and social Web. In order to indicate an agent's cognitive pattern within contexts, their temporal dynamics and their origins, <cite><a href="http://purl.org/ontology/cco/core#">The Cognitive Characteristics Ontology</a></cite> can be used eg. a human language competence.</p>

                  <p><strong>Rights and Responsibilities</strong>: <cite><a href="http://creativecommons.org/ns">Creative Commons Rights Expression Language</a></cite> lets licenses to be described - jurisdiction, permissions, requirements, license and work properties - and having them attached to digital works. The <cite><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons licenses</a></cite> (<abbr title="Creative Commons">CC</abbr>) licenses is intended to enable sharing and reuse of creativity and knowledge, by specifying how something - like scientific and scholarly resources - may be copied, distributed, edited, remixed, and built upon. The <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">Open Digital Rights Language</a></cite> (<abbr title="Open Digital Rights Language">ODRL</abbr>) makes it possible to express permissions and obligations about the usage of content and services. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/">ODRL Vocabulary &amp; Expression</a></cite> describes how to encode such policies.</p>

                  <p><strong>Access Control and Certificates</strong>: The <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl">Web Access Control</a></cite> (<abbr title="Web Access Control">WAC</abbr>) mechanism with the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl">Access Control List</a></cite> (<abbr title="Access Control List">ACL</abbr>) vocabulary describes authorization policies in particular to access and operations - read, write, append, control - that can be done on Web resources by agents or groups. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert">The Cert Ontology 1.0</a></cite> can be used to indicate digital certificate information for agents.</p>

                  <p><strong>Provenance</strong>: <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">The PROV Ontology</a></cite> (<abbr title="The PROV Ontology">PROV-O</abbr>) can be used <q>to represent and interchange provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts</q>. It can be also be <q>specialized for modeling application-specific provenance details in a variety of domains</q>, like for instance <cite><a href="http://www.opmw.org/model/OPMW/">The OPMW-PROV Ontology</a></cite> to describe workflow traces and their templates, which also extends the <cite><a href="http://www.opmw.org/model/p-plan/">P-Plan Ontology</a></cite> that is designed to represent scientific processes. The <cite><a href="https://w3id.org/ro/">Wf4Ever Research Object Model</a></cite> is used to describe workflow-centric <cite>Research Objects</cite>: aggregations of resources along with annotations on those resources relating to scientific workflows. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">Verifiable Claims Data Model and Representations</a></cite> is aimed at expressing a claim; statement made by an entity about a subject, on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and automatically verifiable.</p>

                  <p><strong>Design Lifecycle</strong>: <cite><a href="https://w3id.org/dio">Design Intent Ontology</a></cite> can be used to <q>to capture the knowledge generated during various phases of the overall design lifecycle</q> like for instance the artefacts about software or technical specification requirements, issues, solutions, justifications and evidence.</p>

                  <p><strong>Datasets</strong>: For multi-dimensional statistical data, the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube vocabulary</a></cite> can be used to both model the structure of the hypercube as well as aggregate data which uses its structure definition. The structure is typically an arbitrary number of components: dimension that helps to identify an observation, and one or more measurements about the phenomenon being observed. The <cite><a href="http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery.html">DDI-RDF Discovery Vocabulary</a></cite> (<abbr title="">Disco</abbr>) enables publishing and discovery of metadata about datasets like research and survey data. Disco is generally concerned with microdata descriptions that is on a lower level of aggregation - microdata - than the RDF Data Cube. It is not intended to represent the data itself, but only its structure, where the record-level raw data in its original format is only referenced. Disco also enables a way to describe the aggregation methods that was used to collect the data. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/void/">Describing Linked Datasets with the VoID Vocabulary</a></cite> (<abbr title="Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets">VoID</abbr>) is concerned with metadata about RDF datasets to help with deployment, discovery of data and services, cataloguing and archiving of RDF datasets, as well as linksets between datasets. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/">Evaluation and Report Language</a></cite> (<abbr title="Evaluation and Report Language">EARL</abbr>) can be used to describe the test results and facilitate their exchange between applications. It provides reusable terms for generic quality assurance and validation purposes.</p>

                  <p><strong>Scientific expressions</strong>: <cite><a href="http://sio.semanticscience.org/">Semanticscience Integrated Ontology</a></cite> can be used to describe scientific experiments, for example including their procedure, hypothesis, objectives, study design, analysis, and observations. <cite><a href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/stato.owl">STATO: the statistical methods ontology</a></cite> covers statistical methods, tests, conditions of application, results, as well as aspects of experimental design and descriptions. <cite><a href="http://nanopub.org/guidelines/working_draft/">Nanopublications</a></cite> helps to publish scientific assertions that can be uniquely identified with associated context, attributed to their author, as well as help to preserve associated provenance. <cite><a href="http://purl.org/mp/value">Micropublications</a></cite> can be used to formalise the arguments and evidence in scientific publications.</p>

                  <p><strong>Software Projects</strong>: <cite><a href="http://usefulinc.com/">Description of a Project</a></cite> (<abbr title="Description of a Project">DOAP</abbr>) can be used to describe (open source) software projects like their repositories, bug databases, maintainers, technical specifications they implement, programming languages they use or the platform they run on.</p>

Host languages like HTML and SVG can include the ARIA ontology: <q>roles</q> to alert the purpose of an element; <q>properties</q> to indicate an elements relationship to other things; <q>states</q> to indicate what the element is doing, as well as alerting users about changes in state. ARIA helps to inform consuming assistive technologies such as screen magnifiers, screen readers, text-to-speech software, speech recognition software, alternate input technologies, and alternate pointing devices to create a particular accessibility tree, and to adapt the user interface to a form that works for the person, eg. a screen-reader can read the menu items, or selected option is receiving keyboard focus. WAI-ARIA is extensible and has a number of accessible API mappings. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria/">Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0</a></cite> (<abbr title="Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module">DPUB-ARIA</abbr>) specialises WAI-ARIA's ontology to enable semantic navigation, styling and interactive features in context of digital publishing. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/graphics-aria/">WAI-ARIA Graphics Module</a></cite> is another extension of WAI-ARIA aimed to support structured graphics such as charts, graphs, technical drawings and scientific diagrams, to assistive technologies in order improve accessibility of graphics or diagrams through detailed annotations.</p>

Its specification on <cite><a data-versiondate="2017-10-02T17:15:58Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20171002171558/https://w3c.github.io/scholarly-html/" href="https://w3c.github.io/scholarly-html/">Scholarly HTML</a></cite> proposes a vernacular document format aimed at encoding <em>scholarly articles</em> built on open standards, as well as having them compatible with off-the-self Web browsers. One of its high-level goals is to enable structured metadata as well as semantic enrichments, accessibility, internationalisation. It applies the notion of <q>semantic overlays</q> for its markup patterns with focus on role-based semantics as defined in WAI-ARIA, DPUB-ARIA, and semantic representations using RDFa. The specification explains how concepts for people and organisation, article semantics, schema roles, actions, citations, document rights, and so forth can be marked using appropriate vocabularies - using <cite><a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a></cite> as base. In order to simplify authoring, where applicable, it is encouraged to use RDFa markup patterns where the depth (level of nesting in the DOM tree) for the RDF statements would be relatively flat. One consequences of this rule of thumb may be that there can be duplicate information or parts of the information being human-visible whereas some others would be intended only for machine use.</p>

                <p id="rash"><cite><a data-versiondate="2017-10-02T17:17:56Z" data-versionurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20171002171756/https://essepuntato.github.io/papers/rash-peerj2016.html" href="https://w3id.org/people/essepuntato/papers/rash-peerj2016.html">Research Articles in Simplified HTML</a></cite> (<abbr title="Research Articles in Simplified HTML">RASH</abbr>) is a format accompanied with the RASH Framework <q>for writing HTML-based scholarly papers</q>. RASH aims at sharing scholarly documents through the Web while working <em>within</em> the existing publishing workflow, and is expected to be produced from MS Word, ODT and LaTeX sources. RASH has been developed as a formal grammar using RelaxNG which includes <abbr title="a, blockquote, body, code, em, figcaption, figure, h1, head, html, img, li, link, math, meta, ol, p, pre, q, script, section, span, strong, sub, sup, svg, table, td, th, title, tr, ul">32 elements from HTML5</abbr> based on their printability characteristic - the <code>script</code> element being an exception. Its grammar facilitates RASH documents to run against a markup validator, to convert between sources, rendering for Web and print media, and to extract additional semantics. Its rationale for representing human-visible and machine-readable information in HTML varies eg. title, authors, keywords of an article are used as hidden metadata, and require additional processing to make it human-visible in the Web browser, as such a dependency on JavaScript support and being enabled. The resulting grammar also reflects the approaches like favouring simplicity towards authoring over the expressing accurate or appropriate semantics eg. using <code>h1</code> for all heading levels as opposed to using correct heading levels (<samp>hX</samp>). The format allows DPUB-ARIA and RDFa annotations, as well as embedding JSON-LD, Turtle, and RDF/XML data islands with the <code>script</code> element.</p>

                <p>For historical and technical reasons, the commonality of these existing approaches is that, they are predominantly designed to address:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>print-centric characteristics, as opposed to Web-centric</li>
                  <li>prescriptive data representation for application needs</li>
                  <li>dependence on specific environments, media or device</li>
                  <li>a subset of scholarly information - usually literature, as opposed to annotations or notifications</li>
                  <li>structure and semantics through HTML or XML, as opposed to the RDF layer</li>
                  <li>duplicate information catered to humans and machines separately</li>
                  <li>dependency on additional processing on top of existing information to make it human-readable</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The conventions used to create and consume data in these workflows and applications are inadequate to arrive at an interoperable information space on the Web.</p>

                  <p>As statistical data is inherently highly structured and comes with rich metadata (in form of code lists, data cubes etc.), the application of the Linked Data design patterns is inherently suitable for representation and reuse on the Web. There exists no simple, standardised or (semi)automated way to transform statistical data into Linked Data since the raw data comes in different shapes and forms. Given that SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) is arguably the most widely used standard for statistical data exchange, a great amount of statistical data about our societies is yet to be discoverable and identifiable in a uniform way. We present the design and implementation of SDMX-ML to RDF/XML XSL transformations, as well as the publication of <a href="http://oecd.270a.info/">OECD</a>, <a href="http://bfs.270a.info/">BFS</a>, <a href="http://fao.270a.info/">FAO</a>, <a href="http://ecb.270a.info/">ECB</a>, <a href="http://imf.270a.info/">IMF</a>, <a href="http://uis.270a.info/">UIS</a>, <a href="http://frb.270a.info/">FRB</a>, <a href="http://bis.270a.info/">BIS</a>, and <a href="http://abs.270a.info/">ABS</a> dataspaces with that tooling.</p>

                  <p>Linked Data design principles are increasingly employed to publish and consume high-fidelity, heterogeneous statistical datasets in a distributed fashion. While vast amounts of linked statistics are available, access and reuse of the data is subject to expertise in corresponding technologies. There exists no user-centred interfaces for researchers, journalists and interested people to compare statistical data retrieved from different sources on the Web. Given that the RDF Data Cube vocabulary is used to describe statistical data, its use makes it possible to discover and identify statistical data artefacts in a uniform way. In this article, the design and implementation of a user-centric application and service is presented. Behind the scene, the platform utilizes federated SPARQL queries to gather statistical data from distributed data stores. The R language for statistical computing is employed to perform statistical analyses and visualizations. The Shiny application and server bridges the front-end Web user interface with R on the server-side in order to compare statistical macrodata, and stores analyses results in RDF for future research. As a result, distributed linked statistics with accompanying provenance data can be more easily explored and analysed by interested parties.</p>

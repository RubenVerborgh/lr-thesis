              </blockquote>

              <p>In <cite>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</cite>, Thomas S. Kuhn proposes an explanation for the process of discovery and progress in the history and philosophy of science. Kuhn contended that science did not progress linearly through history, rather it starts with a period that's disorganised, and then a paradigm develops to organise things for day-to-day <q>normal science</q> to take place under the governed paradigm. After some time, <q>anomalies</q> in the paradigm accumulate and lead to a <q>crisis</q> phase where multiple competing paradigms attempt to resolve the issues. This is a particular point in which the community struggles to come to an agreement on the fittest way to practice future science. Finally a <q>paradigm shift</q> - revolution - refers to the last phase where transforming ideas and assertions mature enough to bring order to earlier anomalies, and cause a change in world view. Kuhn reasoned that progress in science was about the notion of moving away from less adequate concepts of and interactions with world in favour of more fruitful. Progress was not a mere line leading to truth.</p>

              <p>As to which paradigm can be objectively determined to be better, Kuhn argued that scientists' decision was ultimately inter-subjective and required value judgement because paradigms; the ideas and assertions within, were not particularly directly comparable. For example, the initial heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus was neither quantitatively or qualitatively more accurate than Ptolemy's geocentric model based on the instruments available at the time. While they were equally internally consistent, geocentrism was even regarded to be consistent with the other accepted theories and doctrines in comparison. Copernicus's case however offered a simpler explanation, broad scope, and deemed to be more fruitful, which were attractive characteristics for Kepler and Galileo when they came to investigate. With Newton's laws for motion and gravitation, the heliocentric model matured enough to set a new course for science and research. Another example demonstrating the complexity of choosing a theory was from the perspective of language and communication. For instance, the term "mass" has radically different meanings in Newton's theory of gravity and Einstein's relativity theory because the definitions are isolated to their respective paradigms. However, General Relativity gave a new lens towards understanding the interaction of mass in space-time. While the definition for mass changed, Einstein's theory was still able to precisely predict Newton's theory, and further provided an explanation for how gravity worked.</p>

              <p>Later on I will describe the paradigm in which scientific and scholarly communication currently situates itself, and propose an alternative paradigm that better integrates with the Web. In order to understand the conceptual frameworks and their adequacy, we will use Kuhn's five characteristics; <q cite="https://web.archive.org/web/20180619083836/https://iweb.langara.bc.ca/rjohns/files/2018/03/Kuhn_theory_choice.pdf">accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness</q> from <cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180619083836/https://iweb.langara.bc.ca/rjohns/files/2018/03/Kuhn_theory_choice.pdf">Objectivity, Value Judgment, and Theory Choice</a></cite>, and justify why the <cite>Linked Research</cite> design principles describes a paradigm that can be adopted for practising scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

              <p>Talk about brief history of SC from 1600s to today.. one paragraph</p>

              <p>Paradigm shift started in the 90s and continues.. held back by tradition.. social desire for change... plus social web with regards to what's normal communication.</p>

              <p>There has been a increasing trend in transitioning from print to electronic over the course of past decades in how scholars communicate.</p>

              <p>The current and widely accepted paradigm is that scientific contributions are peer-reviewed and made available through credible publishers.</p>


              <p>happen, we focus on the effects of the Web medium which caused the way scientists conduct their everyday activities. The <em>effect</em> preceding <em>cause</em> seems counter-intuitive to most of us, however, it becomes apparent as McLuhan describes. That is, how did the medium influence our scientific environment, and how we are suddenly in the middle of it?</p>

              <p>With respect to the focus of this thesis, scholarly communication on the Web is confronted with the <em>crisis</em> on 1) the inadequacy of the traditional mode of scientific information exchange, and 2) access to and reuse of information.</p>

              <p>The World Wide Web is inherently social. In <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/729965164" title="Chapter 10: Web of People, p123">Weaving the Web</a></cite>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> states that he <q cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/729965164">designed it for a social effect – to help people work together – and not as a technical toy</q>. The Web's remarkable growth is fundamentally due to its social characteristics above anything else.</p>

              <!-- <aside class="note">
                <p>Ironically, one of the weaknesses of the system is also the social centralisation of the Web. For instance, the domain name system is ultimately a hierarchical structure which can be brought down or controlled by an authority; states or people.</p>
              </aside> -->

              <p>Berners-Lee mentions that the challenge in creating a global system was to define the basic common rules of protocol for machines to exchange information.</p>

Interoperability meant that different systems without prior out-of-band knowledge should be able to communicate if they agree to operate based on open standards. Evolvability meant that languages and interfaces need to handle extensions, mixing, accommodate diverse scenarios for information exchange, as well as co-evolve.</p>

                      <p>URIs makes it possible for real or abstract objects to be identified. When HTTP URIs are dereferenced different representations (data formats) are made available from corresponding <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738">Uniform Resource Locators</a></cite> (<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>). While URIs makes it possible to identify (name) things on the Web, URLs make it possible for humans and machines to locate and to interact further with content.</p>

                      <p>We refer to W3C's <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/">URIs, URLs, and URNs: Clarifications and Recommendations 1.0</a></cite> from 2001 to distinguish their purpose:</p>

                        <dt>URI</dt>

                        <dd>A specific type of URI that persistently identifies a resource. Once assigned to a resource, it cannot be reassigned.</dd>

                      <p>The Web architecture permits agents to communicate through different Web protocols eg. HTTP, FTP, SMTP are application layer protocols in the <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123">Internet Protocol Suite</a></cite> (<abbr title="Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support">RFC 1123</abbr>). In this thesis, we focus on HTTP for data communication, ie. the requests and responses between Web agents. Web agents interact by exchanging structured messages through the HTTP. For example, when a Web browser initiates a request to access the contents of a resource identified by an HTTP URI (<em>dereferencing</em>), a server responds with a message body including a representation of the resource state, and data about the response. The content of the response URL (HTTP URI) is a particular state in that it has a presentation and controls (affordances) that can be further engaged with, eg. hyperlinks to follow; data forms that can be submitted; location of alternate representations. One particular description of this interaction is given in 2000 by Fielding, in <cite><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Representational State Transfer</a></cite> (<abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr>), a set of architectural constraints for distributed hypermedia systems. There are diverse Web agents, eg. browsers, servers, autonomous scripts, with different capabilities, hence as per <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230">HTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing</a></cite> (<abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing">RFC 7230</abbr>), not all agents are expected to make the same interactions that are presented to them.</p>

                      <p id="safe-interactions">There are two categories of interactions: safe and unsafe. A <dfn>safe interaction</dfn> is one where the requested resource's state does not change. For example, when an agent makes an retrieval request (<code>HTTP GET</code>), it has no obligation beyond dereferencing the URL. An <dfn>unsafe interaction</dfn> on the other hand may cause a resource to change its state, and that the user may be held accountable, depending on the semantics of the interaction. For example, an agent sending a request with a payload (<code>HTTP POST</code>) can get a response indicating the URI of the newly created resource, or that the agent is unauthorised to delete a URI (<code>HTTP DELETE</code>).</p>

                      <p id="representations">When a client requests a resource, the server may return a particular representation of a resource that is the result of a "negotiation" between them. For example, a client may indicate that it would accept the resource in the HTML, Turtle, and JSON-LD data formats, and in English and Armenian. The server could provide a response body using HTML and English.</p>

                      <p id="open-web-platform">Today, Web browsers provide a basis for many forms of human and machine communication. In essence, Web browser is one of the most widely used platforms where a wide range of Internet and Web standards are put to use. The goal of the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/IAB_Prague_2011_slides.html#owp">Open Web Platform</a></cite> (<abbr title="Open Web Platform">OWP</abbr>) is to advance such standards so that technologies like the Web browser can help us to effectively communicate.</p>

                      <p>The Web architecture has no constraints on the type of data formats that can be exchanged between clients and servers. A resource state may have different representations for the information it encodes. For example, HTML+RDFa, Turtle, JSON-LD, and RDF/XML are some RDF serialization formats that can be used to express the same information (semantics) of the requested resource.</p>

                      <p id="the-rule-of-least-power">On designing computer systems and choosing languages, <cite><a about="" href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html" rel="cito:agreesWith">The Rule of Least Power</a></cite> by the W3C Technical Architecture Group recommends that <q cite="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">when publishing on the Web, you should usually choose the least powerful or most easily analyzed language variant that’s suitable for the purpose</q>. Berners-Lee references RDF (see next section) in that it is the most common language of the Web in <cite>Principles of Design, <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP">Principle of Least Power</a></cite>: <q about="" cite="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP" rel="cito:agreesWith" resource="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP">the Semantic Web is an attempt, largely, to map large quantities of existing data onto a common language so that the data can be analyzed in ways never dreamed of by its creators</q>.</p>

                      <p>Berners-Lee states that declarative is preferable to a procedural language as declarative stores the data in reusable ways. HTML for example not only turned out to be simple for people to author, its modularity and extensibility paved the way for other standards. Different kinds of <em>language mixing</em> - composition of data formats - emerged, including for example CSS, JavaScript, RDFa, SVG, and MathML in or alongside HTML. The extension mechanisms in HTML and CSS allowed new semantics or features to be declared in the content that can be processed by conforming Web agents. Web agents get to choose whether to ignore unrecognised content or try to understand and treat unrecognised patterns as errors. For example, when encountering an error, an XHTML document cause the Web browser to stop processing the document or display an error to the user - also known as draconian error-handling. An HTML document on the other hand has a more forgiving error-handling modle. An unrecognised component or non well-formed would let the process continue and no alert gets passed to the user interface.</p>

                  <p>The Web architecture initially used HTML as the language to represent and connect hypermedia documents with one another. HTML's success is indisputable today, and that's perhaps due to its simplicity, to create and reuse; flexibility, for partial understanding to proceed, and; extensibility to allow language mixing. At minimum, HTML proved itself to be a tolerant and durable language that was human-consumable with its default rendering. While the HTML specification continues to evolve by reflecting on the needs of the Web, by design it is scoped to creating and connecting Web documents and applications.</p>

                  <p>Nevertheless, the potential <em>language</em> <q>to describe the interrelationships between things</q> as originally proposed in <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information Management: A Proposal</a></cite> was not realised until the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts">Resource Description Framework</a></cite> (<abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>) came along. RDF is a constructed machine-interpretable language to describe and interlink arbitrary things at any level of abstraction on the Web, and reuses the existing architecture of the Web. Conceptually, RDF was in the fabric of the Web from the start. By comparison, HTML at core is a terse approach to representing and linking knowledge. Later on we will further discuss language mixing with RDF in HTML.</p>

                  <p id="aaa">By design, the Web works by <q cite="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDFnot.html#ER">anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</q> (<abbr title="Anyone can say Anything about Anything">AAA</abbr>). One consequence of AAA is that, while systems (and reasoners within) can operate under both the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption">open-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title="Open-world Assumption">OWA</abbr>) or the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption">closed-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title="Closed-world Assumption">CWA</abbr>), the Web ultimately uses the OWA framework because new knowledge can always make its way into the system, and lack of it [knowledge] does not imply falsity. RDF applies a particular restriction of the AAA principle in that nonsensical, inconsistent, or conflicting information can be created or inferred. It is up to processing applications to determine their confidence on the information.</p>

                  <p><em>Statements</em> in RDF can be expressed in the form of <em>triples</em>: <span class="highlight-language-statement"><span class="highlight-language-subject">subject</span>, <span class="highlight-language-predicate">predicate</span>, <span class="highlight-language-object">object</span></span>, where:</p>

                  <p>The <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987">International Resource Identifier</a></cite> (<abbr title="International Resource Identifiers">IRI</abbr>) is a generalisation of URI (US-ASCII) in that a wider character set (Unicode/ISO 10646) can be used to identify resources on the Web. A Blank node (anonymous resource) is a local identifier scoped to the context it is used in, eg. file, RDF store, and they are not intended to be persistent or portable. Literals are used for values like strings, numbers, and dates.</p>

                  <p id="rdf-graph-theory">A set of triples in RDF (an <cite>RDF Graph</cite>) can be represented as a directed edge-labelled graph: <math alttext="upper G equals left-parenthesis upper V comma upper L comma upper E right-parenthesis" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>V</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>L</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>E</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>, where <math alttext="upper V" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow></math> is the set of <e>vertices</e> (union of subject and object terms), <math alttext="upper L" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></math> is a set of edges labels (predicate terms), and <math alttext="upper E" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow></math> contains triples from <math alttext="upper V vector-or-cross-product upper L vector-or-cross-product upper V" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>&#x2a2f;</mo><mi>L</mi><mo>&#x2a2f;</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow></math>. A subject may have several predicates, and predicates can also be mapped to subjects given that they have their own identity.</p>

                  <p>The structure of RDF statements is similar to:</p>

                  </ul>

                  <p>We can represent the sentence "<span class="highlight-language-statement"><span class="highlight-language-subject">Otlet</span> <span class="highlight-language-predicate">influenced</span> <span class="highlight-language-object">Berners-Lee</span></span>" in one of the RDF syntaxes as follows:</p>

                  <p>RDF facilitates a uniform <q>follow your nose</q> type of exploration by following the semantics in the information provided in order to arrive at another unit of information.

                  <p>In order to address different system and interface needs, different syntaxes for RDF emerged over time, eg. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/">RDF/XML</a></cite> as the grammar to define the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/">XML</a></cite> syntax for RDF graphs; <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a></cite> as the syntax in the natural text form, <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/">RDFa</a></cite> to express RDF statements in markup languages, <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a></cite> to serialize RDF in <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627">JSON</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p>The challenges of Web Science involves social and technical aspects, eg user interface to data, information policy, resilience, diverse devices, collective creativity, and decentralisation. This thesis falls into the domain of Web Science as scholarly communication is inherently social and has broad implications across society. In particular, the thesis examines autonomous and interoperable information systems in context of conducting scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                  <p id="global-village">The Web not only expedited the flow of human knowledge with a friendly interface, it enabled social interactions to take place where it would not have been possible otherwise due to phsyical and political constraints. The global adoption of the Web brought new forms of human association and social action. In essence, the Web is one form of a <q>global village</q> that McLuhan describes where there is greater requirement on individuals to participate than earlier forms of electric media, eg. telegraph, telephone, radio, television. Nevertheless, the way the society reacts to this medium (Web) is perhaps more important than the content that is on it.</p>

                  <p>The openness of the Web and the ease of involvement for both humans and machines (through common protocols) helped its great expansion without a particular central point of failure or coordination. Scholarly communication on the Web happens to be one of the circumstances where different kinds of agents interact, whether they are sentient or something else. <span class="todo">All of the four forces and functions have been realised, technically and socially, on the Web.</span></p>

                  <p>In 1991, recognizing the need for scholars to expedite the exchange of scholarly information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ginsparg">Ginsparg</a> created the <abbr title="Los Alamos National Laboratory">LANL</abbr> preprint archive for <q>e-prints</q>. This provided a moderated central repository where scientists can deposit their articles and have them accessible by anyone, which was a cost-effective solution (estimates were less than 5 USD per submission for administration) for scholars to disseminate research results quickly [<cite><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/pg01unesco.html">Creating a global knowledge network</a></cite>]. It initially started out as a central mailbox with an interface; it adopted FTP in 1991, Gopher in 1992, and finally the World Wide Web in 1994. The articles in the repository are not expected to be peer-reviewed, but rather a place where versioned <q>preprints</q> - considered to precede publications that are peer-reviewed - can be accessed for free. In 2001, the LANL preprint archive eventually became what is currently known as <cite><a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a></cite>. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/license">arXiv license information</a> permits different rights and licenses to be assigned to the scholarly records, ie. anything from public domain, Creative Commons licenses, or with copyright to the publisher or author, provided that arXiv is given sufficient rights to distribute. The repository accepts submissions in TeX, PDF, PostScript, and HTML. This sort of discipline-centric and institution-run preprint exchange mechanism had the technical ingredients to serve as a substitute for the traditional scholarly journal. From 1991 to 2017, arXiv had a <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions">linear increase in submission rate</a> (passing the 1 million mark in 2015). arXiv's early success lead to the emergence of the <a href="#open-archiving">Open Archives Initiative</a> in 1999, and the <a href="#open-access">Open Access</a> movement in 2002.</p>

BOAI is based on the principle that publicly funded research output should be made immediately available, and indefinitely, without access fees and free from most restrictions on copying and reuse, to increase visibility and uptake:</p>

There are many degrees and kinds of wider and easier access to this literature.

                  <p>In order to open up access to scholarly journal literature, BOAI recommends the adoption of two complementary strategies for open access (<abbr title="Open Access">OA</abbr>):</p>

                    <li><q id="boai-self-archving">I. archives-and-repositories</q> (also called <q>green OA</q>)</li>
                    <li><q id="boai-open-access-journals">II. Open-access Journals</q> (also called <q>gold OA</q>).</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><cite><a href="http://cogprints.org/1642/1/nature4.htm">The archives-and-repositories initiative</a></cite> is primarily the act of depositing free copies of <q cite="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">refereed journal articles in open electronic archives</q>. The approach for authors archives-and-repositories was initially implemented through institutional or disciplinary repositories.</p>

                  <p>The term <q>self-archiving</q> in context of OA differs from that of the early practices around preprint services in that there were no constraints set for the status of the scholarly literature, ie. reviewed or not. For OA-based scientific literature, certification and quality-control is a requirement, and is paired with the registration and the archive functions of a published literature. With that frame of mind, <q>self-archiving</q> was not intended to be an alias to <q>self-publishing</q>. OA can be considered to have a coupled model with respect to the <a href="#forces-and-functions">four functions in scholarly communication</a> as defined by Roosendaal and Geurts.</p>

                  <p>The foundations of the OA approach were conceived at a time where major revenue models to cover publishing costs for scholarly literature was through subsidies from institutions, journal subscriptions, or pay-per-view. In this payment model, consumers of the literature were charged either individually or through institutions. In contrast, the <cite>article processing charge</cite> (<abbr title="Article Processing Charge">APC</abbr>) model requires publication costs to be covered upfront, thereby waiving the costs for the consumers of the literature. The emergence and growing use of APC model provided a stable revenue stream to <em>publishers</em> [<cite><a href="https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.72/"></a></cite>], while the technical infrastructure remained relatively unchanged, ie. print-centric publication formats still prevail. Today, APC is the most widely used method to finance OA publishing, with varying levels of fees - averaging around 1000 USD per article [<cite><a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-124"></a></cite>]).</p>

                  <p>The core approach of this thesis is closer to BOAI-1, in that researchers are actively involved in registering, creating awareness, and archiving their scholarly contributions by available means.</p>

                <div dataype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>In 1999, <cite><a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/5841/1/DJpaper.pdf">The deconstructed journal – a new model for academic publishing</a></cite> provided insights on the limitations of the networked-based scholarly publishing models:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li><q>means/end</q> confusion, where journals continue to mimic or replicate existing mechanisms</li>
                    <li>modifications to the system should still match the needs of the traditional scholarly journal</li>
                    <li>cooperating agents can function without going through a central agency, eg. a <q>publisher</q>.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>The role of the journal includes both <q>main</q> (editorial, quality control, recognition of work, marketing, and disseminating) and <q>hidden</q> (subject and community defining, and archiving) functions. The proposed <em>deconstructed journal</em> model is preferable to the <q>paper</q> influenced electronic publishing model in that both main and hidden roles can be accomplished in a distributed manner. Here, Smith emphasises allowing greater academic freedom and shifting of power and control from the monolithic third-parties to the knowledge producers, which could be realised in either an <em>institution-</em> or <em>researcher-centric</em> approach. To get there, Smith acknowledges that for such a new paradigm to be adopted, professional and funding bodies must transition themselves to accepting the decoupling and self-controlled literature publishing model as something equivalent (in terms of academic value) to the traditional model.</p>

                  <p>After two decades, the anecdotal evidence suggests that academia acknowledges the sort of equivalence that Smith describes at varying levels. For example, while literature quality-control can be generally anywhere on the Web, on the other hand, self-published literature remains to be treated as <q>grey literature</q>, ie. any material that is outside of the traditional distribution channels, especially when it comes to academic reward systems.</p>

                  <p>In 2012, <cite><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full">Decoupling the scholarly journal</a></cite> presents an analysis of the four functions of scholarly communication. Priem and Hemminger echo the fact that the scholarly journals bundle multiple functions, and that this tight coupling has hindered innovation, is inefficient, and makes it difficult to improve individual functions. The article also states that the current system, ie. the bundling of the closed publishing and certification models, is unlikely to change if the communication functions are not decoupled, regardless of all the other out-of-band activities - activism or innovation - to improve the publishing models or certification mechanisms. The article diverges from the traditional view of separating registration and archiving functions since the latter <q>necessitates both persistent storage and identification</q>. In other words, if a unit of communication is archived, it has also fulfilled registration. The authors echo many of the ideas of Smith with respect to decoupling and decentralisation, however they only go as far as describing them within the context of scholarly functions operating alongside institutional or third-party online services. While they do not exclude the possibility of <em>researcher-controlled</em> operations, neither it is explored. The article concludes that the nature of the communication revolution will be through the structure and organisation of the units in the system. This is analogous to Roosendaal and Geurts' remark on the creation of new information spaces by an ensemble of units of information.</p>

                  <p>Plethora of guides, best practices, and principles exist in this space.</p>

                  <h4>Data on the Web Best Practices</h4>
                  <p>The W3C Recommendation for <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/">Data on the Web Best Practices</a></cite> (<abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr>) provides a range of best practices, in order to benefit comprehension, processability, discoverability, reuse, trust, linkability, access, and interoperability. The DWBP can be used by <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#bestPractices">data publishers in order to help them and data consumers to overcome the different challenges faced when publishing and consuming data on the Web</q>.</p>

                  <h4>FAIR Guiding Principles</h4>
                  <p>The <cite><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618" title="The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship">FAIR Guiding Principles</a></cite> (2016) is a set of principles intended to facilitate knowledge discovery and reuse for machines and humans. The elements of the principles include:</p>

                  <dl>
                    <dt>Findable</dt>
                    <dd>For human and machine discovery of (meta)data and services by use of globally unique and persistent identifiers, and machine-readable way-finding.</dd>
                    <dt>Accessible</dt>
                    <dd>(Meta)data to be retrievable using open and free standard communication protocols via applicable authentication and authorization mechanisms.</dd>
                    <dt>Interoperable</dt>
                    <dd>(Meta)data using structured knowledge representations to be is interpretable by autonomous agents.</dd>
                    <dt>Reusable</dt>
                    <dd>(Meta)data to optimise the reuse of data with domain-relevant, license, and provenance information.</dd>
                  </dl>

                  <p>The FAIR principles are intended to express policy goals, as opposed to a technical prescription to building a data infrastructure and exchange. From that angle, we can see that the FAIR principles are not constrained to the Web platform.</p>

                  <h4>The Vienna Principles</h4>
                  <p>The <cite><a href="http://viennaprinciples.org/v1/">Vienna Principles</a></cite> proposes twelve principles that is a response to the deficits of the current scholarly communication system (in 2016). The principles are design to help with the debate on how to improve the current system. They include: <q>accessibility, discoverability, reusability, reproducibility, transparency, understandability, collaboration, quality assurance, evaluation, validates progress, innovation, public good</q>.</p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>One of the shortcomings of the research publication system is that scientific literature in electronic formats resemble, mimic, and has similar affordances to printed papers. While the paper-centric approach has been adequate - although not necessary optimal - for human consumption and reuse, it has been insufficient for machine-assisted analysis or reuse. The print-centric affordances lack structure that could enable better aggregation, discovery, processing, and integration in which machines excel at, and in turn help with human-led tasks.</p>

                  <p>The most wide use of the term <q>semantic publishing</q> in scientific literature is defined in <cite><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1087/2009202">Semantic publishing: the coming revolution in scientific journal publishing</a></cite> by Shotton. Here the term <q>semantic publishing</q> is constrained to <q>anything that enhances the meaning of a published journal article, facilitates its automated discovery, enables its linking to semantically related articles, provides access to data within the article in actionable form, or facilitates integration of data between papers</q>. The authors of <cite><a href="http://www.tkuhn.org/pub/sempub/sempub.dokieli.html">Genuine Semantic Publishing</a></cite> argue that with respect to the Semantic Web vision, this definition is <q>too restrictive</q> in a sense that it is concerned mainly about narrated information, and <q>too inclusive</q> in that a shallow semantic publication would still qualify, and defer to the fact that the addition of semantics to published works is an established approach. Kuhn and Dumontier argue that the definition for semantic publishing should be broader in that works without a narrative are accounted for, and narrower in the sense that semantic representations should be incorporated at the time of creating and publishing entities.</p>

                  <p>The <q>genuine semantic publishing</q> prescribes the notion of publishing 1) <em>machine interpretable</em> formal representations, 2) having <em>essential coverage</em> of the claims, 3) <em>authenticated</em> by the contributors, 4) be a <em>primary</em> component of the work, and 5) be part of <em>fine-grained</em> and <em>light-weight</em> containers.</p>

                  <p>There is more to simply publishing machine-readable scientific data on the Web. Analogous to the <q>FAIR principles</q>, data needs to "signal" potential opportunities for <em>reuse</em> as per <cite><a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/29982854/POST-PEER-REVIEW-NON-PUBLISHERS.PDF">Why Linked Data is Not Enough for Scientists</a></cite> (<em>Research Objects</em>).</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Forces and Functions</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>The scientific communication 'market' is an interplay between actors with an objective to exchange units of information along the lines of: academic literature, analysis, annotations (eg assessments, bookmarks, comments) - datasets, evidence, interactive representations, software, observations, provenance, and workflows. Further, researchers commonly want to expose their work beyond the scientific community to the wider world, seeking adoption or contradiction of new ideas and findings. The analysis provided in <cite><a href="http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/conferences/crisp97/roosendaal.html">Forces and functions in scientific communication</a></cite> provides a framework in which to situate the conceptual and technical contributions in this thesis. This framework has had historical influence on research and development pertaining to technical challenges on interoperability, workflows, service sharing, and information modeling, which is discussed further in <a href="#a-brief-history-of-scholarship-on-the-web">scientific communication on the Web</a> and in the remainder of the thesis.</p>

              <p>Roosendaal and Geurts disassembles the scientific communication market as an interplay between four forces and functions. The dynamics between the forces and functions is formed as a tetrad:</p>

              <h3>Forces</h3>

              <p>The scientific communication market consists of four forces with each having complementary parts: <em>actors</em>, <em>accessibility</em>, <em>content</em>, and <em>applicability</em>.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Actor</dt>
                <dd>Any kind of interactive agent that creates or uses information, eg authors, readers, tool implementers, policy makers, application programs.</dd>
                <dt>Accessibility</dt>
                <dd>The availability and retrievability of information, content accessibility.</dd>
                <dt>Content</dt>
                <dd>The generated questions and answers by actors.</dd>
                <dt>Applicability</dt>
                <dd>Transfer of knowledge to science, technology, and society.</dd>
              </dl>

              <h3>Functions</h3>

              <p>Scientific communication consists of four functions: <em>registration</em>, <em>awareness</em>, <em>certification</em>, and <em>archiving</em>.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Registration</dt>
                <dd>Allows claims of precedence for a scientific activity</dd>
                <dt>Awareness</dt>
                <dd>Remaining informed of the observations</dd>
                <dt>Certification</dt>
                <dd>Establishes the validity of registered claims</dd>
                <dt>Archiving</dt>
                <dd>Preservation of scholarly records over time</dd>
              </dl>

              <p>The actor and content forces are generic and internal to the scholarly market, and are considered to be indispensable in that there would not be a scientific communication market if there are no researchers and the artefacts they exchange. The accessibility and applicability forces on the other hand are external forces because they shape, give purpose to, or influence the activities and content.</p>

              <p>The registration and archiving are objective functions in that they are external to the research process, and considered to be indispensable in that information exchange cannot take place if there are no usable identifiers for the units of communication or if no knowledge preservation measures are put in place. Certification and awareness are subjective communication functions - internal to the research process. Registration and awareness are different aspects of <em>scientific observations</em>, ie. facilitating findable information. Certification and archiving are aspects of <em>scientific judgement</em>, ie. act as a filtering mechanism in the information space.</p>

              <p><cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/vandesompel/09vandesompel.html">Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite> (2004) proposes to revise the notion of a unit of scholarly communication in two ways. In a technological sense, it suggests to recognise the compound and dynamic nature of units that work on the Web, eg. content can be the result of a combination of other registered items, make data available through interactions or depend on acquiring externally registered items. Van de Sompel et al. state that in order to empower scholarly communities from a systems perspective, there should be more flexibility on what constitutes a unit of scholarly communication in order to allow registration, as well as factoring timing and the quality of what is to be registered. The authors also acknowledge the presence of an additional function in the market which reflects the academic credit and policy in the current system. That is, <q>rewarding</q> of actors <q>for their performance in the communication system based on metrics derived from that system</q>. For rewarding to take place, the information space needs to provide the ability to extract meaningful metrics.</p>

              <p>Reflecting on the four forces and functions in 2014, <cite><a href="http://andrew.treloar.net/research/publications/ipres2014/iPres2014-paper.pdf">A Perspective on Archiving the Scholarly Web</a></cite> observes the evolution of scholarly communication on the Web, with regard to the shape and behaviour of the units of information. In essence, the emergence of the Web influenced the communication market by transforming it from predominantly being medium-driven into a content-driven ecosystem. The observation is based on the archival process held on the Web; unplanned and unconstrained archiving, organically occurring, by way of Web objects being deposited across distributed and dedicated archival services. Given the dynamic nature of units of communication on the Web, vertical integration (as per the traditional journal-centric ecosystem), ie. stepping through the four functions in order, turned out to be inadequate. Hence, an affirmation of the outlook as outlined in <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/vandesompel/09vandesompel.html">Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite> that the essential functions need to be <q cite="http://andrew.treloar.net/research/publications/ipres2014/iPres2014-paper.pdf">fulfilled in discreet, disaggregated, and distributed manners, and in which a variety of networked pathways interconnect the autonomous hubs that fulfil these functions</q>. The mere act of <q>recording</q> (or <em>registering</em> in the most general sense) a unit of communication is not a replacement for <em>archiving</em> or persistence, even if the freely available Web services are used towards this end. The article calls for another archival paradigm that is based off the intended characteristics of the Web. That is, given the inherently interlinked and dynamic nature of Web objects, archived resources cannot be treated as atomic resources as they do not necessarily contain the complete content. For instance, a research document referring to external media or interactive scripts, aggregated objects, objects changing their states, or potentially being ephemeral. This is in contrast to the traditional journal-centric approach to archival where all material - physical paper - can be eventually tracked to library stacks. Hence, the future of archiving needs to consider the nature of the object, including the degree in which it can be archived. The complexity and care that is required for the proper preservation of digital objects is further described in <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/rosenthal/11rosenthal.html">Requirements for Digital Preservation Systems</a></cite>, where Rosenthal et al. provide a taxonomy of threat models: software, communication, network, economic, organisational, to name a few, pose a particular risk to permanent information loss that's applicable to the characteristics of the unit as described earlier. Thus, it is important to bare these potential issues in mind starting as we consider what the units will contain and how they will be made available.</p>

              <p>With respect to the four forces and functions, the FAIR principles describe a class of interactions with a particular technical characteristic in scholarly communication. That is.. the 4FF can be done in different ways and FAIR is just one way.. <span class="todo">add things from A brief history of scholarship on the Web</span>.</p>

              <p>In recent decades there has been a global shift in communication forms that are used for scientific activities. This perhaps demonstrates a desire for amplification of the senses that are used to consume and create knowledge. For instance, print-centric emphasises the linearity of scientific information representation and its communication, whereas a Web-centric approach makes multimodal interactions possible within the same domain. Scientists need no longer fit their understanding of the world within the confines of static and two-dimensional descriptions of phenomena. The need to travel great distances for first-hand observations and collaboration is also reduced. With electronic media, and more specifically the Web, we have the option to also watch, listen, and participate around measured observations - instantaneously - as the events occur; or after the fact, around persistent and detailed logs. Just as the invention of the printing press transformed the codification and mobility of knowledge, the Web transformed and extended human and machine communication on all fronts. What will be further explored in this thesis is the extent to which our current scholastic activities make use of the inherent qualities of the Web, as well as ways to further take advantage of these qualities.</p>

              <p>In order to help us understand the effects of the Web on scholarly communication, we can use <a href="http://dbpedia.org/Marshall_McLuhan" rel="cito:credits">McLuhan</a>'s tetrad on media effects as a heuristic device, a set of four questions:</p>

              <blockquote cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559" rel="cito:includesQuotationFrom">
                <ul>
                  <li>What does it enhance or intensify?</li>
                  <li>What does it render obsolete or displace?</li>
                  <li>What does it retrieve that was previously obsolesced?</li>
                  <li>What does it produce or become when pressed to an extreme?</li>
                </ul>
                <footer><cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559">Laws of Media</a></cite>, p. 7</footer>
              </blockquote>

              <p>The questions are intended to be complimentary and studied simultaneously. They correspond to four effects: <q>enhances</q>, <q>obsolesces</q>, <q>retrieves</q>, and <q>reverses into</q>. We can use this tetrad to situate the effects and artefacts of scholarly communication on the Web in relation to adjacent mediums, in particular, to print media.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Enhances</dt>
                <dd>access to information, autonomy, social connections, decentralisation, distribution, immediacy,multi-modality</dd>
                <dt>Obsolesces</dt>
                <dd>centralisation, isolation, distance, memorisation, privacy, tactility, travel, linearity, typographical conventions</dd>
                <dt>Retrieves</dt>
                <dd>community, correspondence, direct representation, free expression, dialogue, involvement, public space, self-control</dd>
                <dt>Reverses into</dt>
                <dd>collectivism, degraded information quality, group-think, information overload, fabricated, lack of accountability, information, noise, third-party control</dd>
              </dl>

              <p>The tetrad serves as a conceptual categorisation of effects. It allows us to outline what the medium enables or has implications for based on testable observations. Verifying, realising, and analysing some of these effects in "the real world", or in day-to-day academic practice, is the core of this thesis. Whilst there exists a plethora of possible observations, this thesis will focus on:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>composition of scholarly information</li>
                <li>individual autonomy to create and consume knowledge</li>
                <li>sociality of scholarly communication</li>
              </ul>

              <p>By examining these effects, we can hone in on understanding what the underlying <em>form</em> does to us, society at large, and scientific communication itself. It provides us with a foundation to go further in uncovering the nature of scholarly communication's interplay with the Web. What has it shaped? What are the current challenges? How do we envision the communication to be? How can we use the medium better whether through its original intentions or new?</p>

              <p>The technicalities of these inquiries can have various manifestations, hence this thesis is only intended to reveal a particular configuration which situates itself around <em>contributor-centric scholarly communication on the Web</em>.</p>

              <p>How is scientific communication changed by the mediums employed?</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Understanding the Medium</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>In the 1967 book, <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653" rel="schema:url">The Medium is the Massage</a></cite>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote: <q about="" cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653" rel="cito:agreesWith" resource="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653">at the high speeds of electric communication, purely visual means of apprehending the world are no longer possible; they are just too slow to be relevant or effective</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">1</a>]. While McLuhan’s critique was about the effect of the print media in the electric age, it stands especially valid today in the age of interactive new media. For instance, the <em class="cool-media">World Wide Web</em> is a <q>cool media</q> because its access, multi-linearity, and interactive possibilities offer multi-sensory states for individuals. This is in contrast to <em class="hot-media">print</em>, considered to be a <q>hot media</q>, demanding primarily the full attention of our vision. As the printed word’s requirement for the other senses is minimal, it <em>spoon-feeds</em> the content to the reader in a l-i-n-e-a-r <span class="typographic-sine-wave"><span>f</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>h</span><span>i</span><span>o</span><span>n</span></span>. The literate or print culture is passive and is detached from immediate involvement because the medium has no such requirements. The cooler media on the other hand, requires a greater level of engagement from the audience at a faster rate. This increased engagement allows us to detect change and better recognise patterns, which, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping">Gestalt’s laws of grouping</a>, makes the whole of the information easier to follow and understand.</p>

              <p>The interaction of media with our senses is an inherent property of media. The media's built-in sensory bias affects and transforms human society and psyche. Modern media, like the Web, offer extensible interactions, creative participation, and social engagement. There is a natural human desire to connect and exchange ideas, behaviour, or style with others, as well as to co-create. Given these opportunities, the fundamental question to ask here is, why should research communication be limited to, evaluated by, and rewarded on methods and practices be based on print-centric media? Scholarly communication still uses methods which date back to the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">mechanical movable type printing press</a> (circa 1450), even in the advent of the globally accessible and interactive new media that are at our fingertips today, and at much faster turnaround times from publication to consumption than ever before. The practices correspond to publication workflows that are in place for academic communication, and have remained largely unchanged for over a century. What does it mean to have an academic achievement through a “publication”? If we consider the Web as a potential supplement to or replacement for these older practices, and given that the Web can be purposed for greater possibilities than print alone, then we also need to address the question, <em>what constitutes a scholarly contribution?</em></p>

              <p>Today, it is evident that the typical publishing scenario for scholarly knowledge predominantly requires strict adherence to the <em>printability</em> aspects of the information eg. <span class="unicode-document">page length, typographical guidelines</span>. That is, all of the encompassing data for any given research and development, ie. noteworthy items which the researcher knows, wants to communicate and demonstrate, must be channeled through the characteristics of the print media. In practice, this leads the research community to use tools that are tailored solely for printing or viewing (on screen). This (sticking to print) leads to unnecessary information loss or arbitrary filtering of the content, which might be otherwise preserved if a different medium was used. Since print is only one possible way to represent and communicate the information, it is worthwhile to investigate and employ alternative or complimentary representations that are more appropriate given the qualities of the Web. Traditional electronic document formats are primarily designed and destined for printing and physical distribution - circulate in scientific circles and on the Web, we can make one observation: such formats, on the hot end of the media spectrum, are trying to exist and remain relevant inside a cool medium. We can observe this even in the case of electronic formats and presentations that mimic the old medium; the physical paper.</p>

              <p>I invite the reader to consider two conceptions that describe the effects of technological mediums on society and its similarities with the evolution of scientific paradigms. This will serve as the historical framing for this thesis and the realisation of a range of effects and artefacts by applying the methods and values that are native to the Web.</p>

              <blockquote cite="urn:isbn:9780262633178">
                <p>Gutenberg had, in effect, made every man a reader. Today, Xerox and other forms of reprography tend to make every man a publisher. This massive reversal has, for one of its consequences, elitism. The nature of the mass production of uniform volumes certainly did not foster elites but rather habits of universal reading. Paradoxically, when there are many readers, the author can wield great private power, whereas small reading elites may exert large corporate power.</p>

              </blockquote>

              <p>In the 1962 book, <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/993539009" rel="schema:url">The Gutenberg Galaxy</a></cite>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> explains how the adoption of new technological mediums shifted human culture in Europe through four eras, with emphasis placed on extending our senses:</p>

              <ol type="lower-roman">
                <li>acoustic age (c. until 800 BCE); audile-tactile, preliterate tribal culture,</li>
                <li>age of writing (c. 800 BCE to 1500 CE); audile/visual, manuscript culture,</li>
                <li>age of print (c. 1500 to 1850 CE); visual, mechanical mass communication,</li>
                <li>age of electronic media (c. 1850 CE to present); central nervous system, <q>global village</q></li>
              </ol>

              <p id="acoustic-age">According to McLuhan, the acoustic world depended on speech and hearing for communication. Information was an instantaneous and simultaneous experience for speakers and listeners with a collective identity. Existence was about narrated events and survived through story-telling, songs, and poems.</p>

              <p id="writing-age">When the phonetic alphabet came along, information could be defined, classified, referenced, as well as better preserved. The written word became tangible proof for existence which stretched itself over time and space. While the written word increased the need of our visual system, it brought along the acoustic world with it - early reading was still an oral, and by and large an external (social) activity, as opposed to internal in one's mind.</p>

              <p id="print-age">Through the age of writing to the age of print, the phonetic alphabet transformed from being an audile-tactile experience to purely visual. Gutenberg's printing press (c. 1439 CE) through the process of mechanical mass production had an extensive impact on the circulation of information, and trigger societies to reconfigure their structures. The book's boundaries, uniformity, continuity, linearity, and repeatability had profound influence on the way societies organised their structures and social systems. Print further detribalised social organisations; enabled individualism, fragmentation, government centralism, and nationalism. As a work was mechanically copied, it maintained its consistency and accuracy in comparison to hand copied manuscripts. It was easier to transmit information without personal contact. Then came the responsibility for authors to be consistent with their definitive statements. Once a piece of knowledge was publicly shared, its creator received the prestige and was identifiable - <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/174040346">Connections</a></cite>, 1978, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_%28science_historian%29">James Burke</a>. Print media democratised knowledge as soon as it became a commodity, mass produced and distributed to populations. The general public had a reason to not only access or acquire media like books, but also had a reason to learn to read for themselves, where previously it was necessary to go through a third-party; the wealthy, scholar, or theologian, in order to be informed. The increase in literacy consequently helped the public to be better knowledgeable about world matters without being subject to official or unofficial censorship. As there were more readers, the ability to write fostered the formulation and preservation of individual thought and culture, as well as for the public to voice themselves and question authority. The print media also played a key role in facilitating scientific publishing and the scientific revolution - <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/611804138">The Printing Press as an Agent of Change</a></cite>, 1979, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Eisenstein">Elizabeth Eisenstein</a>.</p>

              <p id="electronic-age">The electric <em>mass</em>-age made it possible to have instantaneous communication in different forms across the globe. Electronic media did not have the same kinds of boundaries that the print had on society and how it re-organised itself. Unlike print media, electronic media like telephone, radio, and television, did not require literacy, and consequently the support of a stable education system. As a whole, it had the same effects on society as the acoustic space created in the tribal world. The speed of information increased, and with it retrieved sociality and involvement which was previously abandoned as the primary mode of information exchange. Perhaps more interestingly, as the flow of information through various electronic media accelerated, it facilitated our natural tendency to recognise patterns and (ir)regularities in data - in comparison to print media which happened to isolate, classify, and immobilise items.</p>

              <p>Later we will revisit McLuhan's studies on the epistemology of experience; psychic and social consequences of technological innovation and apply them to scholarly communication on the Web. For some of the effects and artefacts of media, we can analyse their core characteristics and have them serve as a guide to borrow and enhance desirable qualities that can be put towards a more adequate research paradigm and societal impact.</p>

              <p>In order to understand the effects and artefacts that different mediums instil on society, we can look at the European-centric scientific revolution which overlapped with the transition from the manuscript to the print-centric mode of information organisation and dissemination.</p>

              </blockquote>

              <p>In <cite>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</cite>, Thomas S. Kuhn proposes an explanation for the process of discovery and progress in the history and philosophy of science. Kuhn contended that science did not progress linearly through history, rather it starts with a period that's disorganised, and then a paradigm - a collection of <em>exemplar</em> agreed by scientists on how problems are to be understood - develops to organise things for day-to-day <q>normal science</q> to take place under the governed paradigm. After some time, <q>anomalies</q> in the paradigm accumulate and lead to a <q>crisis</q> phase where multiple competing paradigms attempt to resolve the issues. This is a particular point in which the community struggles to come to an agreement on the fittest way to practice future science. Finally a <q>paradigm shift</q> - revolution - refers to the last phase where transforming ideas and assertions mature enough to bring order to earlier anomalies, and cause a change in world view. Kuhn reasoned that progress in science was about the notion of moving away from less adequate concepts of and interactions with world in favour of more fruitful. Progress was not a mere line leading to truth.</p>

              <p>As to which paradigm can be objectively determined to be better, Kuhn argued that scientists' decision was ultimately inter-subjective and required value judgement because paradigms; the ideas and assertions within, were not particularly directly comparable. For example, early versions of the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus in <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentariolus">Commentariolus</a></cite> (1514), as well as the matured version in <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium">De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</a></cite> (1543) was neither quantitatively or qualitatively more accurate than Ptolemy's <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model">geocentric model</a></cite> (c. 2nd century CE) based on the knowledge and instruments available at the time. While they were equally internally consistent, geocentrism was however regarded to be more consistent with the other accepted theories and doctrines in comparison. Copernicus's case however offered a simpler explanation, broader scope of application, and deemed to be more fruitful. Such were attractive characteristics for Kepler and Galileo when they came to investigate. With Newton's laws for motion and gravitation, the heliocentric model matured enough to set a new course for science and research.</p>

              <p>Another example demonstrating the complexity of choosing a theory was from the perspective of language and communication. For instance, the term "mass" has radically different meanings in Newton's theory of gravity and Einstein's relativity theory because the definitions are isolated to their respective paradigms. However, General Relativity gave a new lens towards understanding the interaction of mass in space-time. While the definition for mass changed, Einstein's theory was still able to precisely predict Newton's theory, and further provided an explanation for how gravity worked.</p>

              <p>Later on I will describe the paradigm in which scientific and scholarly communication currently situates itself, and propose an alternative paradigm that better integrates with the Web. In order to understand the conceptual frameworks and their adequacy, we will use Kuhn's five characteristics; <q cite="https://web.archive.org/web/20180619083836/https://iweb.langara.bc.ca/rjohns/files/2018/03/Kuhn_theory_choice.pdf">accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness</q> from <cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180619083836/https://iweb.langara.bc.ca/rjohns/files/2018/03/Kuhn_theory_choice.pdf">Objectivity, Value Judgment, and Theory Choice</a></cite>, and justify why the <cite>Linked Research</cite> design principles describes a paradigm that can be adopted for practising scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

              <hr />

              <p><cite>The Gutenberg Galaxy</cite> and <cite>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</cite> were coincidently published in 1962. While the accomplishments of McLuhan and Kuhn had differences in methodology and structure, they revealed the overwhelming effects of patterns of change when new technologies and paradigms are adopted by society. These major communication shifts in society and mode of scientific inquiry are considered to be rare and significant events in history of science and humanities. Content follows form; mediums and paradigms shape the space.</p>

              <p>We can start our study by asking: How did mediums influence the scholarly and scientific environments, and how we are suddenly in the middle of it? As the characteristics of the spoken word carried over to writing, and writing to print, print media also influenced electronic media like the Web; hyper-media. Print's typography and knowledge organisation affected the standards, tools and interfaces that are still used today to exchange knowledge on the Web. As units of scholarly information was preserved and exchanged using manuscript and print forms in the pre-electronic age, it preserved its technical and social requirements. Sorry, Ted Nelson. For example, authoring tools help us to design and create electronic documents that resemble print representations even if they are not intended to be printed. McLuhan described this phenomenon as though looking at the <q>rear-view mirror</q>; <q>the old medium is always the content of the new medium</q>, <cite><a href="https://archive.org/details/thisismarshallmcluhanthemediumisthemessage">This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Massage</a></cite>, 1967, Marshall McLuhan. While moving forward by adopting the Web, the content is drawn from the print world.</p>

              <p>We need to examine our assumptions about scholarly communication on the Web in order to understand its social implications; effects and artefacts in order to approach answering research questions. We will start by examining the history of the Web (a <q>social machine</q>) and the scholarly communication on the Web. In essence, the underlying study here is more about the structural changes in scholarly communication, as opposed to the evolution of technical advancements.</p>

                      <p>URIs make it possible for real or abstract objects to be identified. When HTTP URIs are dereferenced different representations (data formats) are made available from corresponding <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738">Uniform Resource Locators</a></cite> (<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>). While URIs makes it possible to identify (name) things on the Web, URLs make it possible for humans and machines to locate and to interact further with content.</p>

                      <p>We refer to W3C's <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/">URIs, URLs, and URNs: Clarifications and Recommendations 1.0</a></cite> from 2001 to distinguish their purpose:</p>

                      <dl id="uri-url-urn">
                        <dt>URI</dt>
                        <dd>Any type of identifier for a Web resource, eg. an HTTP URI.</dd>
                        <dt>URL</dt>
                        <dd>Any type of URI that can be resolved or dereferenced to locate a representation, eg. an HTTP URI is a URL.</dd>
                        <dt>URN</dt>
                        <dd>A specific type of URI that persistently identifies a resource. Once assigned to a resource, it cannot be reassigned.</dd>
                      </dl>

                      <p id="generic-resources">A URI represents a resource as a conceptual entity and can have different electronic representations. The degree of genericity of a resource on the other hand is determined by the authority that allocates the URI. For example, a spectrum of URIs - generic to specific - can be assigned to a resource while conceptually being about the same thing. Time, language, content type, and the target medium are some of the common dimensions of genericity that Web software handles - <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Generic">Generic Resources</a></cite>.</p>

                      <p>In this thesis, we will focus mostly on URIs with the <span class="highlight-uri-scheme">"<span class="highlight-uri-scheme-http">http</span>" scheme</span>. As specified in Axiom 2b: identity, the owner of the HTTP URI defines the identity relationship which exists between a URI and the resources associated with it. Their reuse and persistence are defined by the information publisher - which may be also be the "owner" of the URI space.</p>

                      <p>The Web architecture permits agents to communicate through different Web protocols eg. HTTP, FTP, SMTP are application layer protocols in the <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123">Internet Protocol Suite</a></cite> (<abbr title="Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support">RFC 1123</abbr>). In this thesis, we focus on HTTP for data communication, ie. the requests and responses between Web agents. Web agents interact by exchanging structured messages through the HTTP. For example, when a Web browser initiates a request to access the contents of a resource identified by an HTTP URI (<em>dereferencing</em>), a server responds with a message body including a representation of the resource state, and data about the response. The content of the response URL (HTTP URI) is a particular state in that it has a presentation and controls (affordances) that can be further engaged with, eg. hyperlinks to follow; data forms that can be submitted; location of alternate representations. One particular description of this interaction is given in 2000 by Fielding, in <cite><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Representational State Transfer</a></cite> (<abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr>), a set of architectural constraints for distributed hypermedia systems. There are diverse Web agents, eg. browsers, servers, autonomous scripts, with different capabilities, hence as per <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230">HTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing</a></cite> (<abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing">RFC 7230</abbr>), not all agents are expected to make the same interactions that are presented to them.</p>

                      <p id="safe-interactions">There are two categories of interactions: safe and unsafe. A <dfn>safe interaction</dfn> is one where the requested resource's state does not change. For example, when an agent makes an retrieval request (<code>HTTP GET</code>), it has no obligation beyond dereferencing the URL. An <dfn>unsafe interaction</dfn> on the other hand may cause a resource to change its state, and that the user may be held accountable, depending on the semantics of the interaction. For example, an agent sending a request with a payload (<code>HTTP POST</code>) can get a response indicating the URI of the newly created resource, or that the agent is unauthorised to delete a URI (<code>HTTP DELETE</code>).</p>

                      <p id="representations">When a client requests a resource, the server may return a particular representation of a resource that is the result of a "negotiation" between them. For example, a client may indicate that it would accept the resource in the HTML, Turtle, and JSON-LD data formats, and in English and Armenian. The server could provide a response body using HTML and English.</p>

                      <p id="open-web-platform">Today, Web browsers provide a basis for many forms of human and machine communication. In essence, Web browser is one of the most widely used platforms where a wide range of Internet and Web standards are put to use. The goal of the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/IAB_Prague_2011_slides.html#owp">Open Web Platform</a></cite> (<abbr title="Open Web Platform">OWP</abbr>) is to advance such standards so that technologies like the Web browser can help us to effectively communicate.</p>

                      <p>The Web architecture has no constraints on the type of data formats that can be exchanged between clients and servers. A resource state may have different representations for the information it encodes. For example, HTML+RDFa, Turtle, JSON-LD, and RDF/XML are some RDF serialization formats that can be used to express the same information (semantics) of the requested resource.</p>

                      <p id="the-rule-of-least-power">On designing computer systems and choosing languages, <cite><a about="" href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html" rel="cito:agreesWith">The Rule of Least Power</a></cite> by the W3C Technical Architecture Group recommends that <q cite="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">when publishing on the Web, you should usually choose the least powerful or most easily analyzed language variant that’s suitable for the purpose</q>. Berners-Lee references RDF (see next section) in that it is the most common language of the Web in <cite>Principles of Design, <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP">Principle of Least Power</a></cite>: <q about="" cite="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP" rel="cito:agreesWith" resource="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP">the Semantic Web is an attempt, largely, to map large quantities of existing data onto a common language so that the data can be analyzed in ways never dreamed of by its creators</q>.</p>

                      <p>Berners-Lee states that declarative is preferable to a procedural language as declarative stores the data in reusable ways. HTML for example not only turned out to be simple for people to author, its modularity and extensibility paved the way for other standards. Different kinds of <em>language mixing</em> - composition of data formats - emerged, including for example CSS, JavaScript, RDFa, SVG, and MathML in or alongside HTML. The extension mechanisms in HTML and CSS allowed new semantics or features to be declared in the content that can be processed by conforming Web agents. Web agents get to choose whether to ignore unrecognised content or try to understand and treat unrecognised patterns as errors. For example, when encountering an error, an XHTML document cause the Web browser to stop processing the document or display an error to the user - also known as draconian error-handling. An HTML document on the other hand has a more forgiving error-handling modle. An unrecognised component or non well-formed would let the process continue and no alert gets passed to the user interface.</p>

                  <p>The Web architecture initially used HTML as the language to represent and connect hypermedia documents with one another. HTML's success is indisputable today, and that's perhaps due to its simplicity, to create and reuse; flexibility, for partial understanding to proceed, and; extensibility to allow language mixing. At minimum, HTML proved itself to be a tolerant and durable language that is human-consumable with minimal rendering instructions that's equipped in user-agents. While the HTML specification continues to evolve by reflecting on the needs of the Web, by design it is scoped to creating and connecting Web documents and applications.</p>

                  <p>Nevertheless, the potential <em>language</em> <q>to describe the interrelationships between things</q> as originally proposed in <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information Management: A Proposal</a></cite> was not realised until the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts">Resource Description Framework</a></cite> (<abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>) came along. RDF is a constructed machine-interpretable language to describe and interlink arbitrary things at any level of abstraction on the Web, and reuses the existing architecture of the Web. Conceptually, RDF was in the fabric of the Web from the start. By comparison, HTML at core is a terse approach to representing and linking knowledge. Later on we will further discuss language mixing with RDF in HTML.</p>

                  <p id="aaa">By design, the Web works by <q cite="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDFnot.html#ER">anyone being (technically) allowed to say anything about anything</q> (<abbr title="Anyone can say Anything about Anything">AAA</abbr>). One consequence of AAA is that, while systems (and reasoners within) can operate under both the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption">open-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title="Open-world Assumption">OWA</abbr>) or the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption">closed-world assumption</a></cite> (<abbr title="Closed-world Assumption">CWA</abbr>), the Web ultimately uses the OWA framework because new knowledge can always make its way into the system, and lack of it [knowledge] does not imply falsity. RDF applies a particular restriction of the AAA principle in that nonsensical, inconsistent, or conflicting information can be created or inferred. It is up to processing applications to determine their confidence on the information.</p>

                  <p><em>Statements</em> in RDF can be expressed in the form of <em>triples</em>: <span class="highlight-language-statement"><span class="highlight-language-subject">subject</span>, <span class="highlight-language-predicate">predicate</span>, <span class="highlight-language-object">object</span></span>, where:</p>

                  <p id="rdf-graph-theory">A set of triples in RDF (an <cite>RDF Graph</cite>) can be represented as a directed edge-labelled graph: <math alttext="upper G equals left-parenthesis upper V comma upper L comma upper E right-parenthesis" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>V</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>L</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>E</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>, where <math alttext="upper V" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow></math> is the set of <e>vertices</e> (union of subject and object terms), <math alttext="upper L" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></math> is a set of edges labels (predicate terms), and <math alttext="upper E" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow></math> contains triples from <math alttext="upper V vector-or-cross-product upper L vector-or-cross-product upper V" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>⨯</mo><mi>L</mi><mo>⨯</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow></math>. A subject may have several predicates, and predicates can also be mapped to subjects given that they have their own identity.</p>

                  <p>The structure of RDF statements is similar to:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object">subject–verb–object</a></cite> sentence structure in <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_typology">linguistic typology</a></cite> - used by nearly half of human languages</li>

                  </ul>

                  <p>We can represent the sentence "<span class="highlight-language-statement"><span class="highlight-language-subject">Otlet</span> <span class="highlight-language-predicate">influenced</span> <span class="highlight-language-object">Berners-Lee</span></span>" in one of the RDF syntaxes as follows:</p>

                  <p>RDF facilitates a uniform <q>follow your nose</q> type of exploration by following the semantics in the information provided in order to arrive at another unit of information. Applications can meaningfully interpret and integrate with disparate data without having any out-of-band knowledge, and retrieve more information about the terms.</p>

                  <p>We can describe <span class="highlight-language-subject">Berners-Lee's IRI</span> (subject) by giving it a human-readable <span class="highlight-language-predicate">name</span> (predicate):</p>

                    <div>
                      <p>While IRIs can be used to identify resources, retrieval mechanisms use URIs because the request URI in HTTP protocol is defined as a URI. Hence, the characters in IRI are first mapped to their URI counterparts before the request process.</p>

                      <p>The terms IRI and URI are used interchangeably outside of technical specifications.</p>

The NLP approach would have a different way of making sense of "<span class="highlight-language-subject">Otlet</span>" (a noun) than the declaratively marked noun in RDF using the <span class="highlight-language-subject">IRI for Otlet</span>.</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>

                  <p>In order to address different system and interface needs, different syntaxes for RDF emerged over time, eg. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/">RDF/XML</a></cite> as the grammar to define the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/">XML</a></cite> syntax for RDF graphs; <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a></cite> as the syntax in the natural text form, <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/">RDFa</a></cite> to express RDF statements in markup languages, <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a></cite> to serialize RDF in <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627">JSON</a></cite>.</p>

                  <p>These initiatives are eventually manifested with the <q>Linked Data</q> design principles towards building a <em>Semantic Web</em> where humans and machines can explore the Web of data:</p>

                  <p>The challenges of Web Science involves social and technical aspects, eg user interface to data, information policy, resilience, diverse devices, collective creativity, and decentralisation. This thesis falls into the domain of Web Science as scholarly communication is inherently social and has broad implications across society. In particular, the thesis examines autonomous and interoperable information systems in context of conducting scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

                  <p id="global-village">The Web not only expedited the flow of human knowledge with a friendly interface, it enabled social interactions to take place where it would not have been possible otherwise due to physical or social constraints. The global adoption of the Web brought new forms of human association and social action. In essence, the Web is one form of a <q>global village</q> that McLuhan describes where there is greater requirement on individuals to participate than earlier forms of electric media, eg. telegraph, electric light, telephone, radio, television. Nevertheless, the way the society reacts to this medium (Web) is perhaps more important than the content that is on it.</p>

                  <p>The openness of the Web and the ease of involvement for both humans and machines (through common protocols) helped its great expansion without a particular central point of failure or coordination. Scholarly communication on the Web happens to be one of the circumstances where different kinds of agents interact, whether they are sentient or something else. <span class="todo">All of the four forces and functions have been realised, technically and socially, on the Web.</span></p>

              <p>The main purpose of scholarly articles is to communicate research results and other scholarly work globally with the public. "They make available to the world the results of the intellectual work of scientists, technologists, social scientists, and scholars in the arts and humanities". The most widely accepted and practised purpose for publishing scholarly articles is to put on accurate archival record the results of research; to build on top of earlier knowledge, as well as to "reward authors with credit for the priority of their work". Today's scholarly journal; containing quality-controlled research reports, closely resemble the first journal, <cite>Academie des Scavans</cite> published by <cite>The Royal Society</cite> in 1665.</p>

              <p title="688">The first journal evolved out of the exchange of letters among scholars and the transcripts of the meetings in scholarly societies. "The history of the journal is bound up with the history of the learned society. As noted, the first journals were established to put on permanent record the proceedings of society meetings, and for many years the vast majority of journals were published by societies and distributed only to their members, who paid for them as part of their membership subscriptions. There were, however, exceptions to this rule. Some famous editors established their own journals, and these were named after these founding editors, for example, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hoppe-Seylers Zeitschrift für physiolgische Chemie</cite> and <cite>Liebigs Annalen der Chemi</cite>."</p>

              <p title="688">"A major function of the learned scientific society is the advancement of knowledge in its field, and this has always included the publication and dissemination of information."</p>

              <p title="">"Many of the larger journals.. began to sell subscriptions to nonmembers at relatively higher prices than members pay; most nonmembers' subscripts are institutional."

              </p><p title="688">In <cite>Little Science, Big Science</cite>, Derek de Solla Price, notes that "first journals became prominent as a vehicle of scholarship in sciences. In the humanities, in particular, books remained until recently the main form of publication favored by scholars for recording their work and establishing their reputations." Today, journals in all areas of knowledge exist.</p>

It initially started out as a central mailbox with an interface; it adopted FTP in 1991, Gopher in 1992, and finally the World Wide Web in 1994. The articles in the repository are not expected to be peer-reviewed, but rather a place where versioned <q>preprints</q> - considered to precede publications that are peer-reviewed - can be accessed for free.

The <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/license">arXiv license information</a> permits different rights and licenses to be assigned to the scholarly records, ie. anything from public domain, Creative Commons licenses, or with copyright to the publisher or author, provided that arXiv is given sufficient rights to distribute. The repository accepts submissions in TeX, PDF, PostScript, and HTML. This sort of discipline-centric and institution-run preprint exchange mechanism had the technical ingredients to serve as a substitute for the traditional scholarly journal. From 1991 to 2017, arXiv had a <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions">linear increase in submission rate</a> (passing the 1 million mark in 2015). arXiv's early success lead to the emergence of the <a href="#open-archiving">Open Archives Initiative</a> in 1999, and the <a href="#open-access">Open Access</a> movement in 2002.</p>

                  <p>After some years of prototyping and researcher-centric initiatives, the ideas eventually formulated into the <cite><a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a></cite> (<abbr title="Budapest Open Access Initiative">BOAI</abbr>) in 2002. BOAI is based on the principle that publicly funded research output should be made immediately available, and indefinitely, without access fees and free from most restrictions on copying and reuse, to increase visibility and uptake:</p>

                    <p>The literature that should be freely accessible online is that which scholars give to the world without expectation of payment.

There are many degrees and kinds of wider and easier access to this literature. By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.

                  <p>In order to open up access to scholarly journal literature, BOAI recommends the adoption of two complementary strategies for open access (<abbr title="Open Access">OA</abbr>):</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><q id="boai-self-archving">I. archives-and-repositories</q> (also called <q>green OA</q>)</li>
                    <li><q id="boai-open-access-journals">II. Open-access Journals</q> (also called <q>gold OA</q>).</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><cite><a href="http://cogprints.org/1642/1/nature4.htm">The archives-and-repositories initiative</a></cite> is primarily the act of depositing free copies of <q cite="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">refereed journal articles in open electronic archives</q>. The approach for authors archives-and-repositories was initially implemented through institutional or disciplinary repositories.</p>

                  <p>The term <q>self-archiving</q> in context of OA differs from that of the early practices around preprint services in that there were no constraints set for the status of the scholarly literature, ie. reviewed or not. For OA-based scientific literature, certification and quality-control is a requirement, and is paired with the registration and the archive functions of a published literature. With that frame of mind, <q>self-archiving</q> was not intended to be an alias to <q>self-publishing</q>. OA can be considered to have a coupled model with respect to the <a href="#forces-and-functions">four functions in scholarly communication</a> as defined by Roosendaal and Geurts.</p>

                  <p>The foundations of the OA approach were conceived at a time where major revenue models to cover publishing costs for scholarly literature was through subsidies from institutions, journal subscriptions, or pay-per-view. In this payment model, consumers of the literature were charged either individually or through institutions. In contrast, the <cite>article processing charge</cite> (<abbr title="Article Processing Charge">APC</abbr>) model requires publication costs to be covered upfront, thereby waiving the costs for the consumers of the literature. The emergence and growing use of APC model provided a stable revenue stream to <em>publishers</em> [<cite><a href="https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.72/"></a></cite>], while the technical infrastructure remained relatively unchanged, ie. print-centric publication formats still prevail. Today, APC is the most widely used method to finance OA publishing, with varying levels of fees - averaging around 1000 USD per article [<cite><a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-124"></a></cite>]).</p>

                  <p>The core approach of this thesis is closer to BOAI-1, in that researchers are actively involved in registering, creating awareness, and archiving their scholarly contributions by available means.</p>

                <div dataype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>In 1999, <cite><a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/5841/1/DJpaper.pdf">The deconstructed journal – a new model for academic publishing</a></cite> by John Smith, provided insights on the limitations of the networked-based scholarly publishing models:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li><q>means/end</q> confusion, where journals continue to mimic or replicate existing mechanisms</li>
                    <li>modifications to the system should still match the needs of the traditional scholarly journal</li>
                    <li>cooperating agents can function without going through a central agency, eg. a <q>publisher</q>.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>The role of the journal includes both <q>main</q> (editorial, quality control, recognition of work, marketing, and disseminating) and <q>hidden</q> (subject and community defining, and archiving) functions. The proposed <em>deconstructed journal</em> model is preferable to the <q>paper</q> influenced electronic publishing model in that both main and hidden roles can be accomplished in a distributed manner. Here, Smith emphasises allowing greater academic freedom and shifting of power and control from the monolithic third-parties to the knowledge producers, which could be realised in either an <em>institution-</em> or <em>researcher-centric</em> approach. In this process, journals with the refereeing process would link to the articles with full content mounted on the authors' Web sites. To get there, however, Smith acknowledges that for such a new paradigm to be adopted, professional and funding bodies must transition themselves to accepting the decoupling and self-controlled literature publishing model as something equivalent (in terms of academic value) to the traditional model.</p>

                  <p>After two decades, the anecdotal evidence suggests that academia acknowledges the sort of equivalence that Smith describes at varying levels. For example, while literature quality-control can be generally anywhere on the Web, on the other hand, self-published literature remains to be treated as <q>grey literature</q>, ie. any material that is outside of the traditional distribution channels, especially when it comes to academic reward systems.</p>

                  <p>In 2012, <cite><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full">Decoupling the scholarly journal</a></cite> presents an analysis of the four functions of scholarly communication. Priem and Hemminger echo the fact that the scholarly journals bundle multiple functions, and that this tight coupling has hindered innovation, is inefficient, and makes it difficult to improve individual functions. The article also states that the current system, ie. the bundling of the closed publishing and certification models, is unlikely to change if the communication functions are not decoupled, regardless of all the other out-of-band activities - activism or innovation - to improve the publishing models or certification mechanisms. The article diverges from the traditional view of separating registration and archiving functions since the latter <q>necessitates both persistent storage and identification</q>. In other words, if a unit of communication is archived, it has also fulfilled registration. The authors echo many of the ideas of Smith with respect to decoupling and decentralisation, however they only go as far as describing them within the context of scholarly functions operating alongside institutional or third-party online services. While they do not exclude the possibility of <em>researcher-controlled</em> operations, neither it is explored. The article concludes that the nature of the communication revolution will be through the structure and organisation of the units in the system. This is analogous to Roosendaal and Geurts' remark on the creation of new information spaces by an ensemble of units of information.</p>

                  <p>We will first observe current practices in scholarly information exchange in particular to article and review management<span class="todo">(as well as social interactions?)</span>.</p>

                  <p class="todo">review sytems</p>

                  <hr />

                  <p>In parallel to the existing practices in scholarly information exchange which generally revolve around print-centric workflows, there are best practice and guiding principles which are Web-centric. While the importance of the new approaches are acknowledged by the community, and there is a increasing social demand for their use, its adoption with respect to the state of scholarly market is still in its infancy. Later we will investigate some of the core barriers.</p>

                  <p>While a plethora of guides, best practices, and principles exist in this space.</p>

                  <h4>Data on the Web Best Practices</h4>
                  <p>The W3C Recommendation for <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/">Data on the Web Best Practices</a></cite> (<abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr>) provides a range of best practices, in order to benefit comprehension, processability, discoverability, reuse, trust, linkability, access, and interoperability. The DWBP can be used by <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#bestPractices">data publishers in order to help them and data consumers to overcome the different challenges faced when publishing and consuming data on the Web</q>.</p>

                  <h4>FAIR Guiding Principles</h4>
                  <p>The <cite><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618" title="The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship">FAIR Guiding Principles</a></cite> (2016) is a set of principles intended to facilitate knowledge discovery and reuse for machines and humans. The elements of the principles include:</p>

                  <dl>
                    <dt>Findable</dt>
                    <dd>For human and machine discovery of (meta)data and services by use of globally unique and persistent identifiers, and machine-readable way-finding.</dd>
                    <dt>Accessible</dt>
                    <dd>(Meta)data to be retrievable using open and free standard communication protocols via applicable authentication and authorization mechanisms.</dd>
                    <dt>Interoperable</dt>
                    <dd>(Meta)data using structured knowledge representations to be is interpretable by autonomous agents.</dd>
                    <dt>Reusable</dt>
                    <dd>(Meta)data to optimise the reuse of data with domain-relevant, license, and provenance information.</dd>
                  </dl>

                  <p>The FAIR principles are intended to express policy goals, as opposed to a technical prescription to building a data infrastructure and exchange. From that angle, we can see that the FAIR principles are not constrained to the Web platform. It is neither is it the case that FAIR principles reveal the natural constraints that are imposed by third-party publishers. For instance, if we start our information discovery from the FAIR principles article, we can observe the following:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>0 reviews are known to be publicly available or accessible, meanwhile it is claimed that <q cite="https://www.nature.com/sdata/publish/for-authors#aims-scope">Scientific Data is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal.</q></li>
                    <li>The article proposes several guidelines in human-readable form, however, the guidelines themselves do not conform to <q>F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier.</q></li>
                    <li>Of the 32 citations made in the article:
                      <ul>
                        <li>22 are accessible for user-agents guided by a human, eg. from a Web browser, where 1 only works within a session, ie. the identifiers are ephemeral once the session expires;
                          <ul>
                            <li>18 are available in HTML, 4 only in PDF;</li>
                            <li>0 of the HTML contain standardised machine-readable components, and the patterns differ from one vendor/service provider to another;</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>10 are inaccessible, ie. require special access rights or not found;</li>

                  <p>The <cite><a href="http://viennaprinciples.org/v1/">Vienna Principles</a></cite> proposes twelve principles that is a response to the deficits of the current scholarly communication system (in 2016). The principles are design to help with the debate on how to improve the current system. They include: <q>accessibility, discoverability, reusability, reproducibility, transparency, understandability, collaboration, quality assurance, evaluation, validates progress, innovation, public good</q>.</p> -->


                  <h4>Data Processing, Privacy and Protection</h4>
                  <p>In additions to institutional ethical principles and federal regulations, research can be subject to additional regulations. For instance, the <cite><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">General Data Protection Regulation</a></cite> (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) imposes obligations on organisations that process personal data of individuals in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> area, as well as exporting of data to other areas. Hence, GDPR is relevant for experiments and studies that include human subjects, personally identifiable information (<abbr title="Personally Identifiable Information">PII</abbr>), as well as acquired or inferred personal characteristics. In relation to scholarly communication, ie. research as a basis for data processing, GDPR is permissive and indicates exemptions on the <q>processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject</q>, as well as for scientific research purposes including <q>technological development and demonstration, fundamental research, applied research and privately funded research.</q></p>

                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                  <p>One of the shortcomings of the research publication system is that scientific literature in electronic formats resemble, mimic, and has similar affordances to printed papers. While the paper-centric approach has been adequate - although not necessary optimal - for human consumption and reuse, it has been insufficient for machine-assisted analysis or reuse. The print-centric affordances lack structure that could enable better aggregation, discovery, processing, and integration in which machines excel at, and in turn help with human-led tasks.</p>

                  <p>The most wide use of the term <q>semantic publishing</q> in scientific literature is defined in <cite><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1087/2009202">Semantic publishing: the coming revolution in scientific journal publishing</a></cite> by Shotton. Here the term <q>semantic publishing</q> is constrained to <q>anything that enhances the meaning of a published journal article, facilitates its automated discovery, enables its linking to semantically related articles, provides access to data within the article in actionable form, or facilitates integration of data between papers</q>. The authors of <cite><a href="http://www.tkuhn.org/pub/sempub/sempub.dokieli.html">Genuine Semantic Publishing</a></cite> argue that with respect to the Semantic Web vision, this definition is <q>too restrictive</q> in a sense that it is concerned mainly about narrated information, and <q>too inclusive</q> in that a shallow semantic publication would still qualify, and defer to the fact that the addition of semantics to published works is an established approach. Kuhn and Dumontier argue that the definition for semantic publishing should be broader in that works without a narrative are accounted for, and narrower in the sense that semantic representations should be incorporated at the time of creating and publishing entities.</p>

                  <p>The <q>genuine semantic publishing</q> prescribes the notion of publishing 1) <em>machine interpretable</em> formal representations, 2) having <em>essential coverage</em> of the claims, 3) <em>authenticated</em> by the contributors, 4) be a <em>primary</em> component of the work, and 5) be part of <em>fine-grained</em> and <em>light-weight</em> containers.</p>

                  <p>There is more to simply publishing machine-readable scientific data on the Web. Analogous to the <q>FAIR principles</q>, data needs to "signal" potential opportunities for <em>reuse</em> as per <cite><a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/29982854/POST-PEER-REVIEW-NON-PUBLISHERS.PDF">Why Linked Data is Not Enough for Scientists</a></cite> (<em>Research Objects</em>).</p>

A DOI is aimed at being a persistent identifier for an object it is assigned to, and has the mechanism to refer to the URL of an object where it can be found. That is, a DOI may refer to a landing page about the actual object and not necessarily the object itself; the latter happens to be a common practice in the scholarly information space. For literature that has restricted access, the resolved DOI is typically a webpage where an actor would need to go through the system's <q>paywall</q> or <q>access toll</q> in order to retrieve the content. For open literature, the resolved DOI would generally hyperlink to the actual scientific object in human-interpretable only fashion, or be part of a webpage accompanied by material unrelated to the scientific object itself, ie. information that the scientists neither assembled as part of their research nor intended for the consumer. If the actual URL of the object changes, the DOI's lookup table for the URL has to be updated. Otherwise, they'll point to dead links or unrelated information.</p>

                  <p id="orcid"><cite><a href="https://orcid.org/">Open Researcher and Contributor ID</a></cite> (<abbr title="Open Researcher and Contributor ID">ORCID</abbr>) is a persistent identifier for scientists, academic authors and contributors. An ORCID identifier is specified as an URI. While anyone can create and update their ORCID profile, the identifier is ultimately owned and managed by the ORCID organisation and made available through <code>orcid.org</code>. Each researcher profile has a constraint on what it can express. For most intents and purpose, the free service offered by ORCID is sufficient for researchers, and provides a mechanism where researchers can extend their profile descriptions by linking to their alternative online profiles. One unintended consequence of this popular centralisation in scholarly communication is that a growing number of institutions and publishers require researchers to participate with their ORCID identifiers, as opposed to any URI on the Web. The resulting effects of <a href="https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter">such initiatives</a> are counter to autonomous participation, ie. a researcher has to conform to a third-party's terms and policy. At the same time, the administration of the URI by the ORCID organisation removes the burden of maintaining the URI as well as the profile URL. In this case, a "trusted" third-party takes care of the identifier, where as the researcher takes cares of the content made available at the URL.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>The scientific communication 'market' is an interplay between actors with an objective to exchange units of information along the lines of: academic literature, analysis, annotations (eg assessments, bookmarks, comments) - datasets, evidence, interactive representations, software, observations, provenance, and workflows. Further, researchers commonly want to expose their work beyond the scientific community to the wider world, seeking adoption or contradiction of new ideas and findings. The analysis provided in <cite><a href="http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/conferences/crisp97/roosendaal.html">Forces and functions in scientific communication</a></cite> provides a framework in which to situate the conceptual and technical contributions in this thesis. This framework has had historical influence on research and development pertaining to technical challenges on interoperability, workflows, service sharing, and information modeling, which is discussed further in <a href="#a-brief-history-of-scholarship-on-the-web">scientific communication on the Web</a> and in the remainder of the thesis.</p>

              <p>Roosendaal and Geurts disassembles the scientific communication market as an interplay between four forces and functions. The dynamics between the forces and functions is formed as a tetrad:</p>

              <h3>Forces</h3>

              <p>The scientific communication market consists of four forces with each having complementary parts: <em>actors</em>, <em>accessibility</em>, <em>content</em>, and <em>applicability</em>.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Actor</dt>
                <dd>Any kind of interactive agent that creates or uses information, eg authors, readers, tool implementers, policy makers, application programs.</dd>
                <dt>Accessibility</dt>
                <dd>The availability and retrievability of information, content accessibility.</dd>
                <dt>Content</dt>
                <dd>The generated questions and answers by actors.</dd>
                <dt>Applicability</dt>
                <dd>Transfer of knowledge to science, technology, and society.</dd>
              </dl>

              <h3>Functions</h3>

              <p>Scientific communication consists of four functions: <em>registration</em>, <em>awareness</em>, <em>certification</em>, and <em>archiving</em>.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Registration</dt>
                <dd>Allows claims of precedence for a scientific activity</dd>
                <dt>Awareness</dt>
                <dd>Remaining informed of the observations</dd>
                <dt>Certification</dt>
                <dd>Establishes the validity of registered claims</dd>
                <dt>Archiving</dt>
                <dd>Preservation of scholarly records over time</dd>
              </dl>

              <p>The actor and content forces are generic and internal to the scholarly market, and are considered to be indispensable in that there would not be a scientific communication market if there are no researchers and the artefacts they exchange. The accessibility and applicability forces on the other hand are external forces because they shape, give purpose to, or influence the activities and content.</p>

              <p>The registration and archiving are objective functions in that they are external to the research process, and considered to be indispensable in that information exchange cannot take place if there are no usable identifiers for the units of communication or if no knowledge preservation measures are put in place. Certification and awareness are subjective communication functions - internal to the research process. Registration and awareness are different aspects of <em>scientific observations</em>, ie. facilitating findable information. Certification and archiving are aspects of <em>scientific judgement</em>, ie. act as a filtering mechanism in the information space.</p>

              <p><cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/vandesompel/09vandesompel.html">Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite> (2004) proposes to revise the notion of a unit of scholarly communication in two ways. In a technological sense, it suggests to recognise the compound and dynamic nature of units that work on the Web, eg. content can be the result of a combination of other registered items, make data available through interactions or depend on acquiring externally registered items. Van de Sompel et al. state that in order to empower scholarly communities from a systems perspective, there should be more flexibility on what constitutes a unit of scholarly communication in order to allow registration, as well as factoring timing and the quality of what is to be registered. The authors also acknowledge the presence of an additional function in the market which reflects the academic credit and policy in the current system. That is, <q>rewarding</q> of actors <q>for their performance in the communication system based on metrics derived from that system</q>. For rewarding to take place, the information space needs to provide the ability to extract meaningful metrics.</p>

              <p>Reflecting on the four forces and functions in 2014, <cite><a href="http://andrew.treloar.net/research/publications/ipres2014/iPres2014-paper.pdf">A Perspective on Archiving the Scholarly Web</a></cite> observes the evolution of scholarly communication on the Web, with regard to the shape and behaviour of the units of information. In essence, the emergence of the Web influenced the communication market by transforming it from predominantly being medium-driven into a content-driven ecosystem. The observation is based on the archival process held on the Web; unplanned and unconstrained archiving, organically occurring, by way of Web objects being deposited across distributed and dedicated archival services. Given the dynamic nature of units of communication on the Web, vertical integration (as per the traditional journal-centric ecosystem), ie. stepping through the four functions in order, turned out to be inadequate. Hence, an affirmation of the outlook as outlined in <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/vandesompel/09vandesompel.html">Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite> that the essential functions need to be <q cite="http://andrew.treloar.net/research/publications/ipres2014/iPres2014-paper.pdf">fulfilled in discreet, disaggregated, and distributed manners, and in which a variety of networked pathways interconnect the autonomous hubs that fulfil these functions</q>. The mere act of <q>recording</q> (or <em>registering</em> in the most general sense) a unit of communication is not a replacement for <em>archiving</em> or persistence, even if the freely available Web services are used towards this end. The article calls for another archival paradigm that is based off the intended characteristics of the Web. That is, given the inherently interlinked and dynamic nature of Web objects, archived resources cannot be treated as atomic resources as they do not necessarily contain the complete content. For instance, a research document referring to external media or interactive scripts, aggregated objects, objects changing their states, or potentially being ephemeral. This is in contrast to the traditional journal-centric approach to archival where all material - physical paper - can be eventually tracked to library stacks. Hence, the future of archiving needs to consider the nature of the object, including the degree in which it can be archived. The complexity and care that is required for the proper preservation of digital objects is further described in <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/rosenthal/11rosenthal.html">Requirements for Digital Preservation Systems</a></cite>, where Rosenthal et al. provide a taxonomy of threat models: software, communication, network, economic, organisational, to name a few, pose a particular risk to permanent information loss that's applicable to the characteristics of the unit as described earlier. Thus, it is important to bare these potential issues in mind starting as we consider what the units will contain and how they will be made available.</p>

              <p>With respect to the four forces and functions, the FAIR principles describe a class of interactions with a particular technical characteristic in scholarly communication. That is.. the 4FF can be done in different ways and FAIR is just one way.. <span class="todo">add things from A brief history of scholarship on the Web</span>.</p>

              <p>In recent decades there has been a global shift in communication forms that are used for scientific activities. This perhaps demonstrates a desire for amplification of the senses that are used to consume and create knowledge. For instance, print-centric emphasises the linearity of scientific information representation and its communication, whereas a Web-centric approach makes multimodal interactions possible within the same domain. Scientists need no longer fit their understanding of the world within the confines of static and two-dimensional descriptions of phenomena. The need to travel great distances for first-hand observations and collaboration is also reduced. With electronic media, and more specifically the Web, we have the option to also watch, listen, and participate around measured observations - instantaneously - as the events occur; or after the fact, around persistent and detailed logs. Just as the invention of the printing press transformed the codification and mobility of knowledge, the Web transformed and extended human and machine communication on all fronts. What will be further explored in this thesis is the extent to which our current scholastic activities make use of the inherent qualities of the Web, as well as ways to further take advantage of these qualities.</p>

              <p>In order to help us understand the effects of the Web on scholarly communication, we can use <a href="http://dbpedia.org/Marshall_McLuhan" rel="cito:credits">McLuhan</a>'s tetrad on media effects as a heuristic device, a set of four questions:</p>

              <blockquote cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559" rel="cito:includesQuotationFrom">
                <ul>
                  <li>What does it enhance or intensify?</li>
                  <li>What does it render obsolete or displace?</li>
                  <li>What does it retrieve that was previously obsolesced?</li>
                  <li>What does it produce or become when pressed to an extreme?</li>
                </ul>
                <footer><cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559">Laws of Media</a></cite>, p. 7</footer>
              </blockquote>

              <p>The questions are intended to be complimentary and studied simultaneously. They correspond to four effects: <q>enhances</q>, <q>obsolesces</q>, <q>retrieves</q>, and <q>reverses into</q>. We can use this tetrad to situate the effects and artefacts of scholarly communication on the Web in relation to adjacent mediums, in particular, to print media.</p>

              <dl>
                <dt>Enhances</dt>
                <dd>access to information, autonomy, social connections, decentralisation, distribution, immediacy,multi-modality</dd>
                <dt>Obsolesces</dt>
                <dd>centralisation, isolation, distance, memorisation, privacy, tactility, travel, linearity, typographical conventions</dd>
                <dt>Retrieves</dt>
                <dd>community, correspondence, direct representation, free expression, dialogue, involvement, public space, self-control</dd>
                <dt>Reverses into</dt>
                <dd>collectivism, degraded information quality, group-think, information overload, fabricated, lack of accountability, information, noise, third-party control</dd>
              </dl>

              <p>The tetrad serves as a conceptual categorisation of effects. It allows us to outline what the medium enables or has implications for based on testable observations. Verifying, realising, and analysing some of these effects in "the real world", or in day-to-day academic practice, is the core of this thesis. Whilst there exists a plethora of possible observations, this thesis will focus on:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>composition of scholarly information</li>
                <li>individual autonomy to create and consume knowledge</li>
                <li>sociality of scholarly communication</li>
              </ul>

              <p>By examining these effects, we can hone in on understanding what the underlying <em>form</em> does to us, society at large, and scientific communication itself. It provides us with a foundation to go further in uncovering the nature of scholarly communication's interplay with the Web. What has it shaped? What are the current challenges? How do we envision the communication to be? How can we use the medium better whether through its original intentions or new?</p>

              <p>The technicalities of these inquiries can have various manifestations, hence this thesis is only intended to reveal a particular configuration which situates itself around <em>contributor-centric scholarly communication on the Web</em>.</p>

              <p>How is scientific communication changed by the mediums employed?</p>

            <h2 property="schema:name">Understanding the Medium</h2>
            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p>In the 1967 book, <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653" rel="schema:url">The Medium is the Massage</a></cite>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote: <q about="" cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653" rel="cito:agreesWith" resource="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653">at the high speeds of electric communication, purely visual means of apprehending the world are no longer possible; they are just too slow to be relevant or effective</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">1</a>]. While McLuhan’s critique was about the effect of the print media in the electric age, it stands especially valid today in the age of interactive new media. For instance, the <em class="cool-media">World Wide Web</em> is a <q>cool media</q> because its access, multi-linearity, and interactive possibilities offer multi-sensory states for individuals. This is in contrast to <em class="hot-media">print</em>, considered to be a <q>hot media</q>, demanding primarily the full attention of our vision. As the printed word’s requirement for the other senses is minimal, it <em>spoon-feeds</em> the content to the reader in a l-i-n-e-a-r <span class="typographic-sine-wave"><span>f</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>h</span><span>i</span><span>o</span><span>n</span></span>. The literate or print culture is passive and is detached from immediate involvement because the medium has no such requirements. The cooler media on the other hand, requires a greater level of engagement from the audience at a faster rate. This increased engagement allows us to detect change and better recognise patterns, which, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping">Gestalt’s laws of grouping</a>, makes the whole of the information easier to follow and understand.</p>

              <p>The interaction of media with our senses is an inherent property of media. The media's built-in sensory bias affects and transforms human society and psyche. Modern media, like the Web, offer extensible interactions, creative participation, and social engagement. There is a natural human desire to connect and exchange ideas, behaviour, or style with others, as well as to co-create. Given these opportunities, the fundamental question to ask here is, why should research communication be limited to, evaluated by, and rewarded on methods and practices be based on print-centric media? Scholarly communication still uses methods which date back to the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">mechanical movable type printing press</a> (circa 1450), even in the advent of the globally accessible and interactive new media that are at our fingertips today, and at much faster turnaround times from publication to consumption than ever before. The practices correspond to publication workflows that are in place for academic communication, and have remained largely unchanged for over a century. What does it mean to have an academic achievement through a “publication”? If we consider the Web as a potential supplement to or replacement for these older practices, and given that the Web can be purposed for greater possibilities than print alone, then we also need to address the question, <em>what constitutes a scholarly contribution?</em></p>

              <p>Today, it is evident that the typical publishing scenario for scholarly knowledge predominantly requires strict adherence to the <em>printability</em> aspects of the information eg. <span class="unicode-document">page length, typographical guidelines</span>. That is, all of the encompassing data for any given research and development, ie. noteworthy items which the researcher knows, wants to communicate and demonstrate, must be channeled through the characteristics of the print media. In practice, this leads the research community to use tools that are tailored solely for printing or viewing (on screen). This (sticking to print) leads to unnecessary information loss or arbitrary filtering of the content, which might be otherwise preserved if a different medium was used. Since print is only one possible way to represent and communicate the information, it is worthwhile to investigate and employ alternative or complimentary representations that are more appropriate given the qualities of the Web. Traditional electronic document formats are primarily designed and destined for printing and physical distribution - circulate in scientific circles and on the Web, we can make one observation: such formats, on the hot end of the media spectrum, are trying to exist and remain relevant inside a cool medium. We can observe this even in the case of electronic formats and presentations that mimic the old medium; the physical paper.</p>

              <p>Today's scholarly communication includes some of the effects of the Web, however, it still draws its sociotechnical organisation from the print age and the refereed journal system. It operates as a visual medium. The intention is not to undermine the values of the print-centric approach, but to explore and apply native features of the Web to scholarly communication; autonomous involvement, mass access to create, read, and experience knowledge, and perhaps most importantly, social engagement.</p>

              <p>Our aim is to first acknowledge initiatives and developments that went into scholarly communication in the age of information and Web. If at all, how did the scientific and scholarly community change by the instruments they have employed? Following this analysis, we will move on to devising a scholarly space that is more fitting to the Web - medium.</p>

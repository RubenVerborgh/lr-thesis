    <ul>
      <li>What are the units of human and machine-readable scholarly information? Why self-publishing and what is it like to actualise? What constitutes a scholarly contribution on the Web? What can be deconstructed? What and at what granularity can information be communicated? What are persistent and permanent artefacts? Where would distributed scholarly information exist, be findable and used?</li>
      <li>Does scholarly communication on the Web amplify or intensify decentralisation? Or is it the case where scholarly information is easily centralised? How can the workflows in scholarly communication be realised using Web technologies in a decentralised fashion? Do we have the fundamental mechanisms and ability to derive at feasible implementations to adopt a decentralised scholarly Web paradigm?</li>
      <li>Is there a paradigm shift and what is our situation? What are the effects of social Web on scholars? Are the new forms of involvement revive what was once lost? How can scholars participate and exchange information in a decentralised manner?</li>

  <h2 property="schema:name">Understanding the Medium; Scholarly Communication on the Web</h2>
  <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
    <p>Some context and situation: In the 1967 book, <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653" rel="schema:url">The Medium is the Massage</a></cite>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote that <q about="" cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653" rel="cito:agreesWith" resource="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653">at the high speeds of electric communication, purely visual means of apprehending the world are no longer possible; they are just too slow to be relevant or effective</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">1</a>]. While McLuhan’s critique was about the effect of the print media given the electric age, it stands especially valid today in the age of interactive new media. For instance, the <em class="cool-media">World Wide Web</em> is a <q>cool media</q> because its access, multi-linearity, and interactive possibilities offers multi-sensory and emotional states for individuals. This is in contrast to the <em class="hot-media">print</em>, where it is considered to be a <q>hot media</q> demanding primarily the full attention of our vision. As the printed word’s requirement for the other senses is minimal, it <em>spoon-feeds</em> the content to the reader in a l-i-n-e-a-r <span class="typographic-sine-wave"><span>f</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>h</span><span>i</span><span>o</span><span>n</span></span>. The literate or print culture is passive and is detached from immediate involvement because the medium has no such requirements. The cooler media on the other hand, requires a greater level of engagement from the audience at a faster rate. The speed up in media allows us to detect change better and consequently what we do best; pattern recognition.</p>

    <p>Modern mediums, like the Web, offers extensible interactions, creative participations, and social engagements. There is a natural human desire to <strong>connect</strong> and <strong>exchange</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"><em>memes</em></a> with others, as well as to co-create. Given these opportunities, the fundamental question to ask here is, why should research communication be limited to, evaluated by, and rewarded on methods and practices be based on print-centric media? The methods in question which are still used date back to the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">mechanical movable type printing press</a> (circa 1450), even in the advent of the globally accessible medium and <em>villages</em> that are at our fingertips, vocals, and presence, at much faster turnaround time for publication to consumption than ever before. The practices correspond to the publication workflows that are in place for scientific communication. Naturally one wonders, what does it mean to have an academic achievement through a “publication”? If the Web can be purposed for greater possibilities than that of print alone, then we urgently need to address the question, <em>what constitutes a scholarly contribution?</em></p>

    <p>Today, it is evident that the typical publishing scenario for scholarly knowledge predominantly requires strict adherence to the <em>printability</em> aspects of the information eg. <span class="unicode-document">page length, typographical guidelines</span>. That is, all of the encompassing data for any given research and development, ie. noteworthy items which the researcher knows, wants to communicate and demonstrate, <strong class="rfc2119">must</strong> be channeled through the characteristics of the print media. In practice, this leads the research community to use tools that are tailored solely for printing or viewing (on screen). This (sticking to print) leads to unnecessary information loss or arbitrary filtering of the content, where it can be otherwise preserved via appropriate mediums, if and only if it can be demonstrated that such initiatives are of benefit to the academic community. Since print is one possible way to represent and communicate the information, it is worthwhile to investigate and employ alternative or complimentary representations that are more appropriate given the qualities of the Web. Traditional electronic document formats are primarily designed and destined for printing and physical distribution - circulate in scientific circles and on the Web, we can make one observation: such formats, on the hot end of the media spectrum, are trying to exist and remain relevant inside a cool medium.</p>

    <p id="this-is-not-a-paper"><cite><a href="http://faculty.education.illinois.edu/burbules/papers/paper.1.html">This is Not a Paper</a></cite> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-2">2</a>] - an essay with a title as such, we wish we had written 20 years ago, which is <strong>still</strong> accessible with a single click! - raises a legitimate question <q>whether any journals will exist in paper form within a decade or two</q>. While we can safely answer that question today, our contention is that we are arguably in a better position to look ahead for the upcoming years. There are various emergent social and technical initiatives that are taking place under the umbrella term, <em>Open Science</em>.</p>

    <p>At least within the context of scholastic Web science, it is not only compelling, but crucial for the research community to <em>eat its own dogfood</em> in order to unchain itself from antiquated traditions. A distinction to make here between print-first and Web-first is that it is the environment that influences social consequences, not the technology itself. To start in such endeavor, the primary requirement should be placed on the shoulders of the researchers themselves i.e., to use the mediums and processes that it has created towards technical and social progress. By retaining our focus on enabling researchers we postulate better <strong>access</strong> to knowledge. This is akin to why and how the Web came to be.</p>

    <p>Here our intention is not to undermine the values of the print-centric culture, but rather probe alternative mediums in pursuit of adopting their desirable qualities. <q cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/250420453" title="McLuhan, M. and H.

    </blockquote>

    <p>In order to help us understand the effects of the Web on scholarly communication, we can use <a href="http://dbpedia.org/Marshall_McLuhan" rel="cito:credits">McLuhan</a>'s tetrad on media effects as a heuristic device, a set of four questions:</p>

    <blockquote id="" rel="cito:includesQuotationFrom" cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559">
      <ul>
        <li>What does it enhance or intensify?</li>
        <li>What does it render obsolete or displace?</li>
        <li>What does it retrieve that was previously obsolesced?</li>
        <li>What does it produce or become when pressed to an extreme?</li>
      </ul>
      <footer><cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559">Laws of Media</a></cite>, p. 7</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The questions are presented in the appositional form, ie. intended to be complimentary and studied simultaneously. They correspond to the four effects: <q>enhances</q>, <q>obsolesces</q>, <q>retrieves</q>, and <q>reverses into</q>. We can use this tetrad to situate the effects and artefacts of scholarly communication on the Web in relation to adjacent mediums. To have a working example, we can take the electronic (Web-based) scholarly communication as a medium in contrast to others, as for instance the print-centric environment as mentioned earlier.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Enhances</dt>
      <dd>access to information, decentralisation, distribution, response time, self-publishing, multi-modal content</dd>
      <dt>Obsolesces</dt>
      <dd>anti-sociality, distance, travel, linear information creation and consumption</dd>
      <dt>Retrieves</dt>
      <dd>writing and correspondence, anarchy, dialogue, involvement</dd>
      <dt>Reverses into</dt>
      <dd>information overload, isolation, centralised publishing and distribution services, third-party resource control</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>While the tetrad serves as a conceptual categorisation of effects, ie. understanding what the medium is, enables, or has implications for, we can also verify to what extend they are actualised "in the real world".</p>

    <p>While we could potentially observe and analyse a plethora of effects, in this thesis, we will focus on three areas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the degree of autonomy to create and consume interlinked knowledge</li>
      <li>the distribution of units of scholarly information</li>
      <li>the sociality of the scholarly Web</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By examining these effects, we can hone in on understanding what the underlying <em>form</em> does to us, the society, and the scientific communication itself. It provides us with a foundation to go further in uncovering the true nature of scholarly communication's emergence and interplay with the Web. What has it shaped? What are the current challenges? How do we envision the communication to be? How can we use the medium better whether that's through its original intentions or new?</p>

    <p>The technicalities of these inquiries can have various manifestations, hence this thesis is only intended to reveal a particular configuration which situates itself around <em>contributor-centric scholarly communication on the Web</em>.</p>

    <p>The global shift in communication forms that are used for scientific activities demonstrates the desired amplification of the senses that are used. For instance, the print-centric emphasised on the linearity of scientific information representation and its communication, whereas the Web-centric made multimodal interactions possible within the same domain. Scientists no longer push their understanding of the world within the confines of static and two-dimensional descriptions of phenomenons. They also reduce the need to travel great distances to observe them at first hand, but with the electric media, and more specifically with the advent of the Web, they have the option to also watch, listen, and participate around the measured observations - instantaneously - as the events occur. Just as the invention of the printing press transformed the codification and mobility of knowledge, the Web transformed and extended human and machine communication on all fronts. What will be further explored in this thesis to what extent our current scholastic activities make use of the inherent qualities of the available mediums, as well as ways to further take advantage of them wherever possible.</p>

    <p>How can scientific communication change by the mediums it employs?</p>

<!-- failure to adopt/cultivate -->

    <p>With respect to the focus of this thesis, scholarly communication on the Web is confronted with the <em>crisis</em> on 1) the inadequacy of the traditional mode of scientific information exchange, and 2) access to and reuse of information.</p>

<section id="forces-and-functions" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#forces-and-functions">
  <h2 property="schema:name">Forces and Functions</h2>
  <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
    <p>The scientific communication market is an interplay between researchers (actors) with the objective to exchange units of communication - scientific literature, annotation, notification, dataset, software, interactive knowledge representation or otherwise. An additional objective of the researchers to use information systems to expose their ideas and findings in the global market so that they can be adopted and adapted in our intellectual capital. We adopt the analysis provided in <cite><a href="http://www.physik.uni-oldenburg.de/conferences/crisp97/roosendaal.html">Forces and functions in scientific communication</a></cite> and situate the conceptual and technical contributions (in this thesis) with respect to that. The reason to use this analysis is due to its historical influence on research and development pertaining to technical challenges on interoperability, workflows, service sharing, and information modeling, which we'll discuss further <a href="#scientific-communication-on-the-web">scientific communication on the Web</a> and in the remainder of the thesis.</p>

    <p>Roosendaal and Geurts disassembles the scientific communication market as an interplay between four forces and functions. The dynamics between the forces and functions is formed as a tetrad:</p>

    <h3>Forces</h3>

    <p>The scientific communication market consists of four forces with each having complementary parts: <em>actors</em>, <em>accessibility</em>, <em>content</em>, and <em>applicability</em>.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Actor</dt>
      <dd>Authors (producers) and readers (consumers)</dd>
      <dt>Accessibility</dt>
      <dd>Availability and retrievability</dd>
      <dt>Content</dt>
      <dd>Questions and answers</dd>
      <dt>Applicability</dt>
      <dd>Science and technology</dd>
    </dl>

    <figure>
      <figcaption>The four forces in the scientific communication market</figcaption>
    </figure>



    <h3>Functions</h3>

    <p>The scientific communication consists of four functions: <em>registration</em>, <em>awareness</em>, <em>certification</em>, and <em>archiving</em>.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Registration</dt>
      <dd>Allows claims of precedence for a scientific activity</dd>
      <dt>Awareness</dt>
      <dd>Remaining informed of the observations</dd>
      <dt>Certification</dt>
      <dd>Establishes the validity of registered claims</dd>
      <dt>Archiving</dt>
      <dd>Preservation of scholarly records over time</dd>
    </dl>

    <figure>
      <figcaption>The four function of scientific communication</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The actor and content forces are generic and internal to the market, and are considered to be indispensable. On the other hand, accessibility and applicability are external forces and are indispensable with respect to the functions.</p>

    <p>Registration and archiving are considered to be objective functions in that they are external to the research process. Certification and awareness are subjective communication functions - internal to the research process. Registration and awareness are different aspects of the <em>scientific observations</em>, ie. facilitating findable information, and certification and archiving are aspects of <em>scientific judgement</em>, ie. act as a filtering mechanism in the information space.</p>


    <p>In 2004 <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/vandesompel/09vandesompel.html">Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite> proposes to revise the notion of a unit of scholarly communication in two ways. In a technological sense, it suggests to recognise the compound nature of units that work on the Web. From a systems perspective, in order to empower scholarly communities, there should be more flexibility on what constitutes a unit of scholarly communication in order to allow <em>registration</em>, as well as factoring timing and the quality of what is to be registered.</p>

    <p>Reflecting on the four forces and functions in 2014, <cite><a href="http://andrew.treloar.net/research/publications/ipres2014/iPres2014-paper.pdf">A Perspective on Archiving the Scholarly Web</a></cite> observes the evolution of scholarly communication on the Web, ie. the shape and behaviour of the units of information. In essence, the emergence of the Web influenced the communication market by transforming it from predominantly being medium-driven into a content-driven ecosystem. The observation was based on the archival process held on the open Web, ie. unplanned and unconstrained archiving naturally occurring by way of Web objects being deposited across distributed and dedicated archival services. It is noted that given the dynamic nature of units of communication on the Web, vertical integration (as per the journal-centric ecosystem) of the four functions turned out to be inadequate. Hence, an affirmation of the outlook as outlined in <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/vandesompel/09vandesompel.html">Rethinking Scholarly Communication</a></cite> that the essential functions need to be <q cite="http://andrew.treloar.net/research/publications/ipres2014/iPres2014-paper.pdf">fulfilled in discreet, disaggregated, and distributed manners, and in which a variety of networked pathways interconnect the autonomous hubs that fulfil these functions</q>. The article goes on to state that the mere act of <q>recording</q> (or <em>registering</em> in the most general sense) a unit of communication is not a replacement for <em>archiving</em> or reliable, even if the freely available Web services are used towards the same end. Finally, a call for another archival paradigm that is based off the natural characteristics of the Web medium. That is, given the inherently interlinked and dynamic nature of Web objects, archived resources can not be treated as atomic resources as they do not necessarily contain the complete content. For instance, a research document referring to external media or interactive scripts, aggregated objects, objects changing their states, or potentially being ephemeral. This is in contrast to the traditional journal-centric approach to archival where all material - physical paper - can be eventually tracked to library stacks. Hence, the future of archiving needs to consider the nature of the object, including the degree in which it can be archived.</p>

    <h3 id="open-science">Open Science</h3>
    <p><q>Open Science</q> is a broadly understood notion that is intended to foster <em>open</em> approach to conducting scientific and scholarly endeavours. While there is no single agreed definition or operation of open science, the conceptual consensus is about improving the practice of scientific communication in a transparent, traceable, verifiable, and reusable manner. The <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/44719/2/kmi_foster_iknow.pdf#page=3" title="Fostering Open Science to Research using a Taxonomy and an eLearning Portal">Open Science taxonomy</a> by FOSTER for instance proposes the following top level concepts with horizontal coverage: <q>Open Access, Open Data, Open Reproducible Research, Open Science Definition, Open Science Evaluation, Open Science Guidelines, Open Science Policies, Open Science Projects and Open Science Tools</q>. The conceptual framework of this thesis while aligns itself with the open science movement, it is situated in Web-centric universal network-accessible information, by way of adopting and implementing open Web standards in order to enable scientific information to be interoperable, decentralised, human and machine-readable.</p>


    <h3>Deconstruction and Transformation</h3>
    <p>Several movements emerged from 1990s in order to fundamentally transform scholarly communication using the newly available digital network technologies. As the work in this thesis has a great deal to do with lowering the barriers for <em>access</em> to information on the Web, we first acknowledge some of the foundational initiatives:</p>

      <p>In 1991, recognizing the need for scholars to expedite the exchange of scholarly information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ginsparg">Paul Ginsparg</a> created the <abbr title="Los Alamos National Laboratory">LANL</abbr> preprint archive for <q>e-prints</q>, a moderated centralised repository where scientists can deposit their articles and have them accessible by anyone, which was a cost-effective solution - with estimates being less than 5 USD per submission for administration - for scholars to disseminate research results quickly [<cite><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/pg01unesco.html">Creating a global knowledge network</a></cite>]. Initially started out as a central mailbox with an interface, it adopted FTP (1991), Gopher (1992), and finally the WWW (1994). The articles in the repository are not expected to be peer-reviewed, but rather a place where versioned <q>preprints</q> - considered to precede publications that are peer-reviewed - can be accessed for free. In 2001, the LANL preprint archive eventually became what is currently known as <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>. The <cite><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/license">arXiv license information</a></cite> permits different rights and licenses to be assigned to the scholarly records, ie. anything from public domain, Creative Commons licenses, or copyright to the publisher or author, provided that arXiv is given sufficient rights to distribute. The repository accepts submission formats in TeX, PDF, PostScript, and HTML. This sort of <em>discipline-centric</em> and institution-run preprint exchange mechanism had the technical ingredients to serve as a substitute for the traditional scholarly journal. From 1991 to 2017, arXiv had a <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions">linear increase in submission rate</a> (passing the 1 million mark in 2015, and the rate continuing to increase). arXiv's early success lead to the emergence of the <q><a href="#open-archiving">open archives initiative</a></q> in 1999, and the <q><a href="#open-access">open access</a></q> movement in 2002.</p>

      <p>After some years of prototyping and <em>researcher-centric</em> initiatives, the ideas eventually formulated into the <cite><a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a></cite> (<abbr title="Budapest Open Access Initiative">BOAI</abbr>) in 2002. BOAI is based on the principle that publicly funded research output should be made immediately available, and indefinitely, without access fees and free from most restrictions on copying and reuse, as well as to increase visibility and uptake:</p>

      <blockquote cite="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">
        <p>The literature that should be freely accessible online is that which scholars give to the world without expectation of payment. Primarily, this category encompasses their peer-reviewed journal articles, but it also includes any unreviewed preprints that they might wish to put online for comment or to alert colleagues to important research findings. There are many degrees and kinds of wider and easier access to this literature. By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>In order to open up access to scholarly journal literature, BOAI recommends the adoption of two complementary strategies for open access (<abbr title="Open Access">OA</abbr>): <q id="boai-self-archving">I. Self-Archiving</q> (also called <q>green OA</q>) and <q id="boai-open-access-journals">II. Open-access Journals</q> (also called <q>gold OA</q>). <cite><a href="http://cogprints.org/1642/1/nature4.htm">The Self-archiving initiative</a></cite> is primarily the act of depositing free copies of <q cite="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">refereed journal articles in open electronic archives</q>. The approach for authors self-archiving was initially implemented through institutional or disciplinary repositories.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <h5>Note</h5>
        <p>The term <q>self-archiving</q> in context of OA differs from that of the early practices around preprint services in that there was no constraint set for the status of the scholarly literature, ie. reviewed or not. For OA-based scientific literature, certification and quality-control is a requirement, and is paired with the registration and the archive functions of a published literature. With that frame of mind, <q>self-archiving</q> was not intended to be an alias to <q>self-publishing</q>. From this end, OA can be considered to have a coupled model with respect to the <a href="#actors-and-functions">four functions in scholarly communication</a> as defined by Roosendaal and Geurts.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The foundations of the OA approach was conceived at a time where major revenue models to cover publishing costs for scholarly literature was through subsidies from institutions, journal subscriptions, or pay-per-view. In this payment model, consumers of the literature were charged either individually or through institutions. In contrast, the <cite>article processing charge</cite> (<abbr title="Article processing charge">APC</abbr>) model requires publication costs to be covered upfront, and thereby waving the costs for the consumers of the literature. The emergence and the ever-growing use of APC model provided a stable revenue stream to <em>publishers</em> [<cite><a href="https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.72/"></a></cite>], while the technical infrastructure remained relatively the same, ie. print-centric publication formats still prevail. Today, APC is the most widely used method to finance OA publishing, with varying levels of fees - averaging around 1000 USD per article [<cite><a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-124"></a></cite>]).</p>

      <p>The core approach of this thesis is closer to BOAI-1, in that researchers are actively involved in registering, creating awareness, and archiving their scholarly contributions by available means.</p>

      <h4>Deconstructing Scholarly Journal</h4>
      <p>In 1999, <cite><a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/5841/1/DJpaper.pdf">The deconstructed journal – a new model for academic publishing</a></cite> provides insights on the limitations of the networked-based scholarly publishing models:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><q>means/end</q> confusion, where journals continue to mimic or replicate existing mechanisms</li>
        <li>modifications to the system should still match the needs of the traditional scholarly journal</li>
        <li>cooperating agents can function without going through a central agency, eg. a <q>publisher</q>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The proposed <em>deconstructed journal</em> model is preferable to the <q>paper</q> influenced electronic publishing model in that, both <q>main</q> eg. editorial, quality control, recognition of work, marketing, and disseminating, and <q>hidden</q> eg. subject and community defining, and archiving, roles of the journal can be accomplished in a distributed manner. Here, Smith emphasises on allowing greater academic freedom and shifting of power and control from the monolithic third-parties to knowledge producers, which could be realised in a <em>institution</em> or <em>researcher-centric</em> approach. To get there, Smith acknowledges that for such a new paradigm to be in adopted, professional and funding bodies transition themselves to accept the decoupling and self-controlled literature publishing model as something equivalent to the traditional model.</p>

      <p>After two decades, the anecdotal evidence suggests that academia partly acknowledges the sort of equivalence that Smith describes at varying degrees. For instance, while literature quality-control, eg peer-review, is typically conducted around the journal, and done anywhere on the Web, <em>self-publication</em> of literature remains to be treated as <q>grey literature</q> when it comes to the academic reward systems.</p>

      <p>In 2012, <cite><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full">Decoupling the scholarly journal</a></cite> presents its analysis based off the consensus where scholarly communication has four <em>functions</em>. Priem and Hemminger echo the fact that the scholarly journals still bundle multiple functions, and that this tight coupling has hindered innovation, deemed to be inefficient, and made it difficult to improve individual functions. The article also states that the <q>current system</q>, ie. the bundling of the closed publishing process and certification models, is unlikely to change if the communication functions are not decoupled, regardless of all the other out-of-band activities eg. activism to boycott certain publishers or library subscriptions. The article declares its divergent view from the traditional separation of registration and archiving functions in that the latter <q>necessitates both persistent storage and identification</q>. In other words, if a unit of communication is archived, it has also fulfilled registration. The authors echo many of the ideas as Smith with respect to decoupling and decentralisation, however they only go as far as describing them within the context of scholarly functions operating alongside institutional or third-party online (micro)services. While they do not exclude the possibility of researcher <em>controlled</em> operations, it is neither explored. The article concludes that the nature of the communication revolution will be through the structures of the system. This is analogous to Roosendaal and Geurts' remark on different ensemble of units of information, and the creation of new information spaces. The remainder of this thesis will manifest a plausible information space.</p>

      <p>It is worthwhile to note here that the models that has been described so far primarily focus on <em>institutional</em> or <em>subject</em> repository driven scholarly communication. They are contrasted against typical third-party (for-profit) involvement which impose a particular arrangement of the coupling of the scholarly information space as per <em>forces and functions</em>. In the remainder of this thesis, we focus on enabling a <em>researcher-centric</em> model, where while it can be situated within the same <q>deconstructing</q> or <q>decoupling</q> school of thought, its pursuit is in embracing researcher-controlled by means of the native characteristics of the Web eg. decentralisation, freedom of expression, while still adhering to the scientific method.</p>

    <h3 id="open-archiving">Open Archiving</h3>
    <p>While the act of archiving of scholarly records in and itself is not conceptual, ie. rather a tangible undertaking, it is evident from the <em>deconstruction</em> models that archiving is integral to access and preservation of the scientific knowledge for societal use. Scientific communication over the Web is inherently about distributed activities. To this end, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000229151223/http://www.openarchives.org/ups1-press.htm">first meeting</a> in 1999 was held to agree on recommendations to <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february00/vandesompel-ups/02vandesompel-ups.html">address interoperability challenges</a> - such as search and linking - for data across publicly available distributed <em>self-archiving</em> solutions. To promote the global acceptance of self-archiving, and interoperability systems being core to its successful adoption, the <cite><a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">Open Archives Initiative</a> (<abbr title="Open Archives Initiative">OAI</abbr>) Organization</cite> was established to take on the development of technical recommendations - for metadata standards, discovery, retrieval. This lead to the evolution of recommendations such as <cite><a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">OAI-PMH</a></cite> for <q>Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</q>, and its successor <cite><a href="http://www.openarchives.org/rs/resourcesync">ResourceSync</a></cite> as resource synchronization framework for servers, <cite><a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/toc">OAI-ORE</a></cite> for <q>Object Reuse and Exchange</q>, and <cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089">Memento</a></cite> which specifies a time dimension to the Web architecture. In the 2015 article, <cite><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november15/vandesompel/11vandesompel.html">Reminiscing About 15 Years of Interoperability Efforts</a></cite>, authors summarise the lessons learned on interoperability efforts by concluding that a shift from <em>repository-centric</em> to <em>web-centric</em> perspective was essential in order have a viable and sustainable scholarly ecology.</p>

    <h3 id="fair-principles">FAIR Principles</h3>
    <p>The <cite><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618" title="The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship">FAIR Principles</a></cite> proposes guiding principles to facilitate <q>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable</q> knowledge discovery for machines as well as reuse by individuals.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Findable</dt>
      <dd>For human and machine discovery of (meta)data and services by use of globally unique and persistent identifiers, and machine-readable way-finding.</dd>
      <dt>Accessible</dt>
      <dd>(Meta)data to be retrievable using open and free standard communication protocols via applicable authentication and authorization mechanisms.</dd>
      <dt>Interoperable</dt>
      <dd>(Meta)data using structured knowledge representations to be is interpretable by autonomous agents.</dd>
      <dt>Reusable</dt>
      <dd>(Meta)data to optimise the reuse of data with domain-relevant, license, and provenance information.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The principles can be applied to create different information spaces. With respect to the <em>four forces and functions</em>, they can describe a class of interactions with a particular technical characteristic in scholarly communication.</p>


    <h3 id="web-a-social-machine">Web: A Social Machine</h3>
    <p>The World Wide Web is inherently social. In <cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/729965164" title="Chapter 10: Web of People, p123">Weaving the Web</a></cite>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> states that he <q cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/729965164">designed it for a social effect – to help people work together – and not as a technical toy</q>. The Web's remarkable growth is fundamentally due to its <em>social</em> characteristics above anything else.</p>

    <aside class="note">
      <p>Ironically, one of the weaknesses of the system is also the social centralisation of the Web. For instance, the domain name system is ultimately a hierarchical structure where it can be brought down or controlled by an authority; states or people.</p>
    </aside>

    <p>Berners-Lee mentions that the challenge to create a global system with was to define the basic common rules of protocol for machines to exchange information. Initially the essential parts of the Web architecture started with the Uniform Resource Identifier (<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (<abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>), and the Hypertext Markup Language (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>).</p>

    <p id="the-rule-of-least-power">On designing computer systems and choosing languages, <cite><a about="" rel="cito:agreesWith" href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">The Rule of Least Power</a></cite> by the W3C Technical Architecture Group recommends that <q cite="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">when publishing on the Web, you should usually choose the least powerful or most easily analyzed language variant that’s suitable for the purpose</q>. Berners-Lee's also states that declarative is preferable to a procedural language that stores the data in that there is reuse in many ways. For instance, <q about="" rel="cito:agreesWith" resource="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP" cite="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP">The Semantic Web is an attempt, largely, to map large quantities of existing data onto a common language so that the data can be analyzed in ways never dreamed of by its creators</q>. HTML for example not only turned out to be simple for people to author, its modularity and extensibility paved the way for many standards and language mixing, eg. CSS, JavaScript, RDFa, SVG, MathML.</p>

    <p><em>Evolvability</em> can be seen as an attribute or a quality of a system, such that the system can survive in the long run. This is especially important when we want to have different publishing systems to be interoperable over time based on new needs. To be more specific, we are seeking to employ technology stacks that are likely to handle extensions and accommodate diverse scenarios for knowledge acquisition in the future. While it is not always clear or easy to predict which technologies will persevere in the future, we can pursue features like simplicity, flexibility, decentralization, interoperability, and tolerance. This line of thinking is expressed in Berners-Lee's Web architecture comments on the <cite><a about="" rel="cito:agreesWith" href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Evolution.html">Evolution of the Web</a></cite>.</p>

    <p>Berners-Lee gives a set of <em>axioms</em> for URIs as the backbone of what makes the Web a universal information space:</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#uri">
      <dl>
        <dt>Axiom 0: Universality 1</dt>
        <dd>Any resource anywhere can be given a URI</dd>

        <dt>Axiom 0a: Universality 2</dt>
        <dd>Any resource of significance should be given a URI.</dd>

        <dt>Axiom 1: Global scope</dt>
        <dd>It doesn't matter to whom or where you specify that URI, it will have the same meaning.</dd>

        <dt>Axiom 2a: sameness</dt>
        <dd>a URI will repeatably refer to "the same" thing</dd>

        <dt>Axiom 2b: identity</dt>
        <dd>the significance of identity for a given URI is determined by the person who owns the URI, who first determined what it points to.</dd>
      </dl>

      <footer><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html#uri" rel="cito:includesQuotationFrom">Universal Resource Identifiers -- Axioms of Web Architecture</a></cite></footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>URIs makes it possible for real or abstract information objects to be identified and referred to. URIs enable machine-readable structured data to be described in a way where related information can be discovered by exercising a <em>follow-your-nose</em> type of exploration.</p>

    <p>This initiative is manifested with the <q>Linked Data</q> design principles towards building a <em>Semantic Web</em> where humans and machines can explore the Web of data:</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData">
      <ol>
        <li>Use URIs as names for things</li>
        <li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.</li>
        <li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)</li>
        <li>Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.</li>
      </ol>
      <footer><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData">Linked Data - Design Issues</a></cite></footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The <cite><a href="">Resource Description Framework</a></cite> (<abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>) is a constructed machine-interpretable <em>language</em>. In essense, statements in RDF have the <em>subject–verb–object</em> sentence structure as per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_typology">linguistic typology</a>. Just to have a simple example, we can represent a sentence like "Otlet influenced Berners-Lee" in one of the formal syntaxes of RDF like <samp>&lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Otlet&gt; &lt;http://dbpedia.org/ontology/influenced&gt; &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Berners-Lee&gt; .</samp>. What's interesting to note here is that each component (from the natural language): subject, verb, and object use URIs in order to signal unambigious <em>naming</em> - that's in contrast to having the machine interpret the characters "O", "t", "l", "e", "t". Visiting the locations of the URIs can reveal more information which then becomes the <em>subject</em>. So, given that statement, applications can meaningfully interpret, integrate with disparate data without having any out-of-band knowledge, and retrieve more information about the entities and terms. As far as a machine is concerned, RDF makes it possible to express explicit statements about <em>things</em>.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <div>
        <p>We used the term <q>verb</q> which is closest to natural language as a jumping point for our example. In RDF, the terms <q>property</q> and <q>predicate</q> are more common. For all intents and purposes, it is equivalent to the term <q>attribute</q> from the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model">entity–attribute–value</a></cite> (<abbr title="entity–attribute–value">EAV</abbr>) model.</p>

        <p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing">Natural-language processing</a></cite> is an area of study more concerned with making sense of data that's represented in natural language. That would have a different way of making sense of "Otlet" then we have with the URI for Paul Otlet.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Even before the formalisation of RDF concepts and abstract syntax, it was conceptually in the fabric of interconnecting objects on the Web as originally proposed in <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information Management: A Proposal</a></cite>. Over time RDF was realised in different ways; initially a terse approach in HTML which provided a both human and machine-readable way to express and act on knowledge. Then came the richer syntaxes, along with the use of vocabularies and ontologies, in order to address different system and interface needs eg. RDF/XML, Turtle, RDFa, JSON-LD.</p>

    <p>The Web is a medium that is an implementation of a <q>global village</q> that McLuhan describes through the use of electronic media. The openness of the Web and the ease of <em>involvement</em> for both humans and machines (through common protocols) helped for its great expansion without a particular central point of failure. Scholarly communication on the Web happens to be one of the gatherings where different kinds of agents interact, whether they are sentient or something else. All of the four forces and functions have been realised on the Web.</p>

    <p>The scope of the technologies and standards described in this thesis and the contributions therein is within the context of the Web. There are undoubtedly many exciting initiatives and developments that use Internet protocols which can address many of the same challenges (and maybe even better), however we stick to one of its applications; the Web.</p>

    <p>The concepts we have discussed so far intersects with the <cite><a href="https://linkedresearch.org/">Linked Research</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Research">LR</abbr>) initiative. LR is a natural emergence in that it shares a common ancestry with the ideas and ideals. LR is intended to describe a Web and researcher-centric information and interaction space for scientific communication.</p>

    <p>As per <cite><a href="https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/263347">A Framework for Web Science</a></cite>, Linked Research can be seen as one way to further the science of decentralised information systems in context of scholarly communication, as well as the the study of <em>Web Science</em> itself.</p>

    <p>LR is about interconnectivity and increasing the degree of connections by fully embracing Linked Data on the Web stack as the primary medium for scholarly activities. While the initiative to use the Web to its full potential for scholarly activities is nothing new, nor is it the case to develop missing standards towards interoperability among systems. The LR approach is however timely in the sense that a substantial number of fundamental Web standards have matured to trigger a paradigm shift in scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

        <p>What are desirable qualities? We first outline some of the categories of challenges that remain to be addressed to facilitate a Web-based scholarly communication:</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Scientific dialogue is social and part of the commons. Articulation of contributions with no interference using any creative means to co-create and co-participate.</p>

            <p>We inherit:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <h5>Article 19.</h5>

              <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>The <em>freedom of expression</em> in context of scientific communication does not entail that an actor with a "personal journal" (like a blog post) can expect their works to be treated on equal grounds as a "scientific literature". Here, by <em>freedom of expression</em> we mean that actors should not be subject to arbitrary constraints on how they communicate their contributions with the rest of the world.</p>

            <p>In context of <q>publishing</q>, we solely refer to the <q>registration</q> function, ie. irrespective of any certification or acknowledgement on the quality of work. Hence, when a researcher initiates registration, we refer to that as <q>self-registration</q>. The act of <em>self-publishing</em> eg. on own's personal website, is considered to be <em>self-registration</em>. There are no constraints on where units of communication (<q>research objects</q>) can exist on the Web. For instance, authors of an article can have their profiles anywhere on the Web, annotations and notification can created by different users and applications, and stored at different locations.</p>

    <section id="semantic-publishing" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="semantic-publishing">
      <h3 property="schema:name">Semantic Publishing</h3>
      <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <p>One of the shortcomings of the research publication system is that scientific literature in electronic formats resemble, mimic, and has similar <em>affordances</em> to printed papers. While the paper-centric approach has been adequate - although not necessary efficient - for human consumption and reuse, it has been inadequate for machines. The print-centric design's affordances lack formal semantics and structure that could be better discovered, processed, and integrated in which machines excel in, and in turn helping with human tasks.</p>

        <p>The most widely usage of the term <q>semantic publishing</q> in scientific literature and elsewhere is defined in <cite><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1087/2009202/asset/leap0740.pdf?v=1&amp;t=jdzzr617&amp;s=db0b411177b78a26f03beaec45612e75f160fbfb">Semantic publishing: the coming revolution in scientific journal publishing</a></cite>. Here the term <q>semantic publishing</q> is constrained to <q>anything that enhances the meaning of a published journal article, facilitates its automated discovery, enables its linking to semantically related articles, provides access to data within the article in actionable form, or facilitates integration of data between papers</q>. The authors of <cite><a href="http://www.tkuhn.org/pub/sempub/sempub.dokieli.html">Genuine Semantic Publishing</a></cite> argue that with respect to the Semantic Web vision, this definition is <q>too restrictive</q> in a sense that it is concerned mainly about narrated information, and <q>too inclusive</q> in that a shallow <em>semantic</em> publication would still qualify - authors argue that this is already an existing practice and does not particularly introduce new or specialised enhancements.</p>

        <p>There is more to simply publishing machine-readable scientific data on the Web. Analogous to the <q>FAIR principles</q> as mentioned earlier, data needs to "signal" potential opportunities for <em>reuse</em> in the most general sense, as per <cite><a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/29982854/POST-PEER-REVIEW-NON-PUBLISHERS.PDF">Why Linked Data is Not Enough for Scientists</a></cite>.</p>

        <p>The <q>genuine semantic publishing</q> prescribes the notion of publishing 1) <em>machine interpretable</em> formal representations, 2) having <em>essential coverage</em> of the claims, 3) <em>authenticated</em> by the contributors, 4) be a <em>primary</em> component of the work, and 5) be part of <em>fine-grained</em> and <em>light-weight</em> containers. While this criteria is valuable and can also be exercised by following LR's machine-readable design principle, we do not prescribe it in order to not conflict with the <q>freedom of expression</q> principle. From another perspective, since the <q>genuine</q> criteria ultimately imposes a particular design on <em>semantic publishing</em>, we do not dictate at the conceptual layer.</p>

        <p>We argue that (<em>genuine</em>) <em>semantic publishing</em> is only realistically possible if we adopt the LR principles and implement it when designing systems. If for instance a third-party imposes a specific way to express knowledge, whether it is through file formats and their structure and semantics; what (meta)data to include or not include; or inclusion and use of interactive components; the quality of the communication will suffer. Information loss naturally occurs simply because what the actors wish to convey in their message, and how, will have to be filtered down in order to solely fit the requirements of a third-party ("publisher"). Therefore, at this juncture, the fundamental requirement is whether actors 1) can express their needs, and 2) it can be used. Otherwise, the definitions as to what constitutes <em>semantic publishing</em> works only on the platonic level can't be applied, and unfortunately irrelevant.</p>

        <p>The Web is capable of offering rich interactions for humans and machines. While scientists have adopted the Web as an ideal medium to exchange knowledge, it is not being used efficiently or optimally due to social and technical reasons. What we can ask is if it is possible to use the medium to its full potential, and observe the <em>effects</em>. We can also consider the consequences of pushing this to the extreme - as per McLuhan's <em>reverses into</em>. LR is not only a set of design principles to shape the technical scholarly communication market, but an initiative to strive to experience the full effects of the Web by adopting what it has to offer. In part, LR is an attempt to actively break away from practices which still enhances isolationism. Technologies that enable or enhance the social dimensions on the Web for example makes involvement possible. The design principles are intended to have that effect.</p>

        <p>LR is also a conceptual framework that describes how implementations in scholarly communication can interoperate. Its philosophy is influenced by the social machinery to build a knowledge Web for humans and machines as part of a cooperating system. Knowledge tends to get lost if it can't be retrieved, hence it has limited value. This is particular why a holistic approach to universal access for all agents is an important criteria.</p>

        <p>Is this LR a yet another model? Not exactly. Its design is in agreement with certain qualities of the existing works and practices in the wild. However, LR looks at the problem space by revisiting the natural characteristics of the medium, and what the actors can utmost use or achieve in context of scientific communication. Arbitrary or artificial barriers are anti-patterns.</p>

        <p class="todo">Are there idealogical and technology traps? What is the scope? What are some of the instabilities or inadequate use of the system? What is missing or could use more development/attentions?</p>

        <p>Sooner or later we need a strategy to address questions like: <em>What do we aim to accomplish?</em> <em>Who is trying to do it and for the benefit of whom?</em> <em>How do we know whether we are making progress and when we have succeeded?</em></p>

        <p>Potential solutions to these questions and new challenges need to address the connection and the gap between researchers, academic and public institutions, as well as what ends up in the commons. It is not just about researchers making their contributions available on the Web, or about conferences requesting semantically annotated contributions, or operating with transparent peer-review. All of these things must move in combination. However, what cane be executed today:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt id="working-together-researchers">Researchers</dt>
          <dd>Researchers take full responsibility of their contributions. This can be at any Webspace they put trust on or have sufficient authority over, eg. personal site, institutions’ student and faculty pages. Making their work as <q>Webby</q> as possible eg. linking their arguments and citations to others', interactive story-telling or experimentation possibilities for their readers. Researchers should take special care to ensure URI persistence and archiving of their work.</dd>

          <dt id="working-together-conferences-and-journals">Conferences and journals</dt>
          <dd>In person conferences and online journals should encourage and accept research publications which use native Web technologies. Support transparent and attributed peer-review process. Aggregation or proceedings of the events should be machine-friendly and archival measures should be taken in addition to that of researchers.</dd>

          <dt id="working-together-public-institutions">Public institutions</dt>
          <dd>Given sufficient evidence of the Web Science community’s acknowledgement of research as well as its contributions, eg. peer-reviews, academic institutions should officially acknowledge such work towards academic credit. Libraries should make the community’s output discoverable, catalogued, enriched, among many other things.</dd>

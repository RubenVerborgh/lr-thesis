  <h2 property="schema:name">Understanding the Medium; Scholarly Communication on the Web</h2>
  <div property="schema:description">
    <p>Some context: In the 1967 book, <span about="urn:isbn:9781584230700" typeof="schema:Book"><span rel="owl:sameAs" resource="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653"></span><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/medium-is-the-massage-an-inventory-of-effects/oclc/47679653" rel="schema:url">The Medium is the Massage</a></span>, <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a></cite> wrote that <q about="" cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47679653" rel="cito:agreesWith" resource="urn:isbn:9781584230700">at the high speeds of electric communication, purely visual means of apprehending the world are no longer possible; they are just too slow to be relevant or effective</q> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-1">1</a>]. While McLuhan’s critique was on the overall position of the print media given the electric age, it stands especially valid today in the age of interactive new media. For instance, the <em class="cool-media">World Wide Web</em> is a <q>cool media</q> because its access, multi-linearity, and interactive possibilities offers multi-sensory and emotional states for individuals. This is in contrast to the <em class="hot-media">print</em>, where it is considered to be a <q>hot media</q> demanding primarily the full attention of our vision. As the printed word’s requirement for the other senses is minimal, it <em>spoon-feeds</em> the content to the reader in a l-i-n-e-a-r <span class="typographic-sine-wave"><span>f</span><span>a</span><span>s</span><span>h</span><span>i</span><span>o</span><span>n</span></span>. The literate or print culture is passive and is detached from immediate involvement because the medium has no such requirements. The cooler media on the other hand, requires a greater level of engagement from the audience at a faster rate. The speed up in media allows us to detect change better and consequently what we do best; pattern recognition.</p>

    <p>The new media, like the Web, offers extensible interactions, creative participations, and social engagements. There is a natural human desire to <strong>connect</strong> and <strong>exchange</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"><em>memes</em></a> with others, as well as to co-create. Given these opportunities, the fundamental question to ask here is, why should research communication be limited to, evaluated by, and rewarded on the archaic methods and artificial practices? The methods in question which are still used date back to the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">mechanical movable type printing press</a> (circa 1450), even in the advent of the globally accessible medium and <em>villages</em> that are at our fingertips, vocals, and presence, at much faster turnaround time for publication to consumption than ever before. The artificial practices correspond to the publication workflows that are in place for majority of the Web conferences and journals. Naturally one wonders, what does it mean to have an academic achievement through a “publication”? If the Web can be purposed for greater possibilities than that of print alone, then we urgently need to address the question, <em>what constitutes a scholarly article?</em></p>

    <p>Today, it is evident that the typical publishing scenario for scholarly knowledge predominantly requires strict adherence to the <em>printability</em> aspects of the information e.g., <span class="unicode-document">page length, typographical guidelines</span>. That is, all of the encompassing data for any given research and development, i.e., noteworthy items which the researcher knows, wants to communicate and demonstrate, <strong class="rfc2119">must</strong> be channeled through the characteristics of the print media. In practice, this leads the research community to use tools that are tailored solely for printing or viewing (on screen). This (sticking to print) leads to unnecessary information loss or arbitrary filtering of the content, where it can be otherwise preserved via appropriate mediums, if and only if it can be demonstrated that such initiatives are of benefit to the academic community. Since print is one possible way to represent and communicate the information, it is worthwhile to investigate and employ alternative or complimentary representations that are more appropriate given the qualities of the Web. As document formats like PDF and Word - which are primarily designed and destined for printing and physical distribution - circulate in scientific circles and on the Web, we can make one observation: such formats, on the hot end of the media spectrum, are trying to exist and remain relevant inside a cool medium.</p>

    <p id="this-is-not-a-paper"><cite><a href="http://faculty.education.illinois.edu/burbules/papers/paper.1.html">This is Not a Paper</a></cite> [<a class="ref" href="#ref-2">2</a>] - an essay with a title as such, we wish we had written 20 years ago, which is <strong>still</strong> accessible with a single click! - raises a legitimate question <q>whether any journals will exist in paper form within a decade or two</q>. While we can safely answer that question today, our contention is that we are arguably in a better position to look ahead for the upcoming years. There are various emergent social and technical initiatives that are taking place under the umbrella term, <em>Open Science</em>.</p>

    <p>At least within the context of scholastic Web science, it is not only compelling, but crucial for the research community to <em>eat its own dogfood</em> in order to unchain itself from antiquated traditions. A distinction to make here between print-first and Web-first is that it is the environment that influences social consequences, not the technology itself. To start in such endeavor, the primary requirement should be placed on the shoulders of the researchers themselves i.e., to use the mediums and processes that it has created towards technical and social progress. By retaining our focus on enabling researchers we postulate better <strong>access</strong> to knowledge. This is akin to why and how the Web came to be.</p>

    <p>Here our intention is not to undermine the values of the print-centric culture, but rather probe alternative mediums in pursuit of adopting their desirable qualities.</p>

<section id="effects-and-artefacts" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#effects-and-artefacts">
  <h2 property="schema:name">Effects and artefacts</h2>
  <div property="schema:description">
    <p>In order to help us understand the effects of the Web on scholarly communication, we can use <a href="http://dbpedia.org/Marshall_McLuhan" rel="cito:credits">McLuhan</a>'s tetrad on media effects as a heuristic device, a set of four questions:</p>

    <blockquote id="" rel="cito:includesQuotationFrom" cite="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559">
      <ul>
        <li>What does it enhance or intensify?</li>
        <li>What does it render obsolete or displace?</li>
        <li>What does it retrieve that was previously obsolesced?</li>
        <li>What does it produce or become when pressed to an extreme?</li>
      </ul>
      <footer><cite><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981396559">Laws of Media</a></cite>, p. 7</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The questions are presented in the appositional form, ie. intended to be complimentary and studied simultaneously. They correspond to the four effects: <q>enhances</q>, <q>obsolesces</q>, <q>retrieves</q>, and <q>reverses into</q>. We can utilise this tetrad to situate the effects and artefacts of scholarly communication on the Web in relation to adjacent mediums. To have a working example, we can take the electronic (Web-based) scholarly communication as a medium in contrast to others, as for instance the print-centric environment as mentioned earlier.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Enhances</dt>
      <dd>access to information, decentralisation, distribution, response time, self-publishing, multi-modal content</dd>
      <dt>Obsolesces</dt>
      <dd>anti-sociality, distance, travel, linear information creation and consumption</dd>
      <dt>Retrieves</dt>
      <dd>writing and correspondence, anarchy, dialogue, involvement</dd>
      <dt>Reverses into</dt>
      <dd>information overload, isolation, centralised publishing and distribution services, third-party resource control</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>While the tetrad serves as a conceptual categorisation of effects, ie. understanding what the medium is, enables, or has implications for, we can also verify to what extend they are actualised "in the real world".</p>

    <p>While we could potentially observe and analyse a plethora of effects, in this thesis, we will focus on three areas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the degree of autonomy to create and consume interlinked knowledge</li>
      <li>the distribution of units of scholarly information</li>
      <li>the sociality of the scholarly Web</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By examining these effects, we can hone in on understanding what the underlying <em>form</em> does to us, the society, and the scientific communication itself. It provides us with a foundation to go further in uncovering the true nature of scholarly communication's emergence and interplay with the Web. What has it shaped? What are the current challenges? How do we envision the communication to be? How can we use the medium better whether that's through its original intentions or new?</p>

    <p>The technicalities of these inquiries can have various manifestations, hence this thesis is only intended to reveal a particular configuration which situates itself around <em>contributor-centric scholarly communication on the Web</em>.</p>

    <p>The global shift in communication forms that are used for scientific activities demonstrates the desired amplification of the senses that are used. For instance, the print-centric emphasised on the linearity of scientific information representation and its communication, whereas the Web-centric made multimodal interactions possible within the same domain. Scientists no longer push their understanding of the world within the confines of static and two-dimensional descriptions of phenomenons. They also reduce the need to travel great distances to observe them at first hand, but with the electric media, and more specifically with the advent of the Web, they have the option to also watch, listen, and participate around the measured observations - instantaneously - as the events occur.</p>

  <h2 property="schema:name">Anticipating a Paradigm Shift</h2>
  <div property="schema:description">
    <p>There has been a increasing trend in transitioning from print to electronic over the course of past decades in how scholars communicate. 

     . we borrow the conceptual framework on how <em>paradigms</em>. In the <cite>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</cite>, Kuhn describes...</p>
<p>
     happen, we focus on the effects of the Web medium which caused the way scientists conduct their everyday activities. The <em>effect</em> preceding <em>cause</em> seems counter-intuitive to most of us, however, it becomes apparent as McLuhan describes. That is, how did the medium influence our scientific environment, and how we are suddenly in the middle of it?</p>

<!-- failure to adopt/cultivate -->

    <p>With respect to the focus of this thesis, scholarly communication on the Web is confronted with the <em>crisis</em> on 1) the inadequacy of the traditional mode of scientific information exchange, and 2) access to and reuse of information.</p>


    <p>The current and widely accepted paradigm is that scientific contributions are peer-reviewed and made available through credible publishers. As to what constitutes a "publisher" is left at the discretion of different scholarly communities.</p>

    <p>rear-view mirror.. and paradigms
    <p>By confronting the Web using the same methods as with print, the scientific market seeks security and comfort.

    <p><q>Open Science</q> is a broadly understood notion that is intended to foster <em>open</em> approach to conducting scientific and scholarly endeavours. While there is no single agreed definition or operation of open science, the conceptual consensus is about improving the practice of scientific communication in a transparent, traceable, verifiable, and reusable manner. A taxonomy by FOSTER for instance proposes the following top level concepts: <q>Open Access, Open Data, Open Reproducible Research, Open Science Definition, Open Science Evaluation, Open Science Guidelines, Open Science Policies, Open Science Projects and Open Science Tools</q> [<a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/44719/2/kmi_foster_iknow.pdf#page=3" title="Fostering Open Science to Research using a Taxonomy and an eLearning Portal"></a>]. The conceptual framework of this thesis while aligns itself with the open science movement, it is situated in Web-centric universal network-accessible information, by way of adopting and implementing open Web standards in order to enable scientific information to be interoperable, decentralised, human and machine-readable.</p>

    <p class="todo">Not sure where this (section) should go</p>

    <p>Some high-level probes.. please leave your sense of logic at the door:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What are the units of human and machine-readable scholarly information? Why self-publishing and what is it like to actualise? What constitutes a scholarly contribution on the Web? What can be deconstructed? What and at what granularity can information be communicated? What are persistent and permanent artefacts? Where would distributed scholarly information exist, be findable and used?</li>
      <li>Does scholarly communication on the Web amplify or intensify decentralisation? Or is it the case where scholarly information is easily centralised? How can the workflows in scholarly communication be realised using Web technologies in a decentralised fashion? Do we have the fundamental mechanisms and ability to derive at feasible implementations to adopt a decentralised scholarly Web paradigm?</li>
      <li>Is there a paradigm shift and what is our situation? What are the effects of social Web on scholars? Are the new forms of involvement revive what was once lost? How can scholars participate and exchange information in a decentralised manner?</li>
    </ul>

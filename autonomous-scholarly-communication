              <p>The term <q>information society</q> is used to loosely denote increasingly central role of information and communication technologies in social and economic activity. With the advent of the Internet and the Web, the production, distribution, and consumption of instantaneously accessible networked knowledge has further shaped social policies and practices around the world.</p>

              <p>As discussed earlier, throughout history, the complex connections between communication technologies and society transformed control structures of civilisations. Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan argued that electronic media, unlike any other, compressed time and space - creating a <q>global village</q> - as well as facilitating the influence and potential of centralised control. While the Internet reinforces democratic (re)distribution of communicative power, and that the Web is inherently decentralised - with the exception of centralised notion of DNS tied to social agreements - today, centralisation of all forms of information exchange and various forms of (algorithmic) censorship - state or self-imposed - is commonplace; from governments, social media services, to increasingly various and variety of large-scale systems that collect, adopt, organise, and share data in diverse sectors. For instance, major information organisations like Google, Facebook, Elsevier, to a long tail of (social) media services, exert a great influence on how and what information can be accessible, expressible, reusable, with respect to the cost of human capital, as well as impact on society by creating information and <q>filter bubbles</q>. In essence knowledge elitism takes different shapes and forms on society. Information control tends to happen through system designs that are inherently centralised.</p>

              <p>The information needs of an individual, community, and society vary from personal, local, to global. For instance, an individual can expect to participate in exchanging knowledge and goods autonomously. Given access to the Internet and the Web, researchers can register and control their URI space; personal data storage and applications; as well as social scholarly activity without intermediaries. Scientific communities can make their discoveries available in the global commons; take part in reproducing and replicating others' findings; be involved in quality-control and certification processes, and interact with participants and information. Given these activities, the output for the society is a democratic knowledge exchange at the global level.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p about="" id="problem-statement" rel="schema:hasPart"><span about="#problem-statement" property="schema:description" typeof="deo:ProblemStatement">While the Web was originally conceived as a decentralised <em>application</em> running on the Internet, where every organisation and individual can participate, it became increasingly centralised with <a class="todo" href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/">less than 1% of the servers serving more than 99% of the content</a>. The domination of centralisation is essentially due to economic and state incentives, and it has shaped the technical infrastructure: it is currently much easier and more efficient to author, manage, publish, and search large amounts of similarly structured content using a centralised platform. Blogger, YouTube and Facebook, for example, are centralised authoring, publishing, and search platforms for blog posts, videos or social network content respectively.</span></p>

              <p>However, independence of centralised platforms is a necessity for ownership of published ideas, and to establish a relation of trust. For example, Facebook has been accused of <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/05/yes_facebook_is_biased_now_it_should_admit_it.html">bias</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth">false information</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/facebook-vietnam-war-photo-nudity.html">censorship</a>â€”but rather than blaming this on any particular platform, we identify it as an unavoidable result of centralisation. After all, there is a continued tension between unrestricted publication rights on the one hand, and a guarantee of balanced, verified information on the other. In a fully decentralised setting, each source is filterless and responsible for its own quality and reputation, while others are free to selectively (dis-)trust certain sources using any mechanism they desire.</p>

              <p>Decentralised authoring, publication, and annotation furthermore have the potential to impact areas in which centralisation currently determines the pace of evolution. Scientific publishing, for instance, is often bound to centralised review and dissemination processes. Instead, rigorous scientific discourse could be realised with an open, decentralised environment for the annotation of manuscripts, which has the potential to engage more people sooner. Trust then no longer stems from a finite process with limited transparency, but is rather continuously assessed by repeated independent validation. Publication thereby becomes the starting point rather than the end point.</p>

              <p>If we want to strengthen the decentralised nature of the Web again, we need to develop technologies to simplify the decentralised authoring, management, exploration, and search of Web content.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>Given our half a millennia of experience on mass print publishing, and a half century on electronic publishing, we are in a position to situate, examine and question our assumptions as to what constitutes scholarly knowledge exchange and participation in context of the Web. For instance, the Web - a <em>read-write</em> space - inherently enables anyone to be a "publisher" while each researcher can exercise their full creativity without being subject to arbitrary constraints. Any third-party involvement is fundamentally subject to conflict with that notion. Yet, third-party involvement, typically through for-profit service providers injunction with academic institutions and libraries, influence the quality and availability of publicly-funded research output and exchange. The social and professional incentives for academics can be traced to the workflows exerted by external forces.</p>

              <p>If scholarly communication is predominately and increasingly driven by the Web, how can we approach to integrate scholarly affairs with the inherent properties of the Web? One way to look at this is by examining history: the printing press played a major role in moving the non-literate public to learn to read and write for themselves. Given the Web, we find ourselves in a similar situation, with different modes of communication. In order to use the Web effectively - as far as taking advantage of its built-in characteristics, the research community essentially needs to better position itself to self-publish and disseminate their knowledge, as well as be more attributable and accountable in their social engagement. This kind of ongoing (r)evolution is vital for the advancement of scholarly communication; unchaining itself from antiquated and inadequate practices, towards actual and complete Web-centric information flows and participations, in order to better aid societal advancement.</p>

              <p>The notion of <q>control yourself</q> can postulate that the knowledge creators and participants can objectively demonstrate that self-publishing of different units of communication can be socially, technically, and financially preferable to a third-party's handling of the same information and interactions, as well as their reuse. It opens up the possibility for autonomous (decentralised) participation, enabling universally accessible units that are human and machine-readable, as well as socially aware interactions.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>Let us now first turn our attention to the technicalities of this matter given available media at hand.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">

              <p id="internet-web-protocols">The foundational communication and transfer protocols of the Internet and the Web (eg. <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>/<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>, <abbr title="Domain Name Server">DNS</abbr>, <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>) are designed to operate in a decentralised and distributed manner. In terms of global functionality, removing a single node from the network - a machine with an IP address - does not halt the whole network. Similarly, when an HTTP URL is no longer available (eg. typical "404 Not Found", "410 Gone" status messages), the other URLs are not affected. This particular behaviour, where the Web being functional without requiring bi-directional hyperlinks is considered to be a "feature" (rather than a "bug") of the overall system. However, Ted Nelson disputes this design choice with respect to the original Hypertext design.</p>

              <p id="read-write-web">As discussed previously the <abbr title="Architecture of the World Wide Web">AWWW</abbr> enables the identification, discovery and description of information for the notion of a <q>Read-Write Web</q> where servers and clients interact using Web standards. Generally speaking <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">create, read, update and delete</a></cite> (<abbr title="Create, Read, Update and Delete">CRUD</abbr>) are the basic functions of persistent storage as well as conventions for user-interfaces to view and change information. Each CRUD operation can be mapped to an interaction method of the Web architecture. For example, the request function for HTTP would be: <math alttext="upper R e q u e s t equals upper M e t h o d vector-or-cross-product upper I upper R upper I vector-or-cross-product upper M e d i a upper T y p e vector-or-cross-product upper B o d y" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>Request</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>Method</mi><mo>â¨¯</mo><mi>IRI</mi><mo>â¨¯</mo><mi>MediaType</mi><mo>â¨¯</mo><mi>Body</mi></mrow></math>, where <em>create</em> would map to HTTP method(s) <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>; <em>read</em> (retrieve) to <code>GET</code>; <em>update</em> (modify) to <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PATCH</code>; and <em>delete</em> (destroy) to <code>DELETE</code>, and <em>IRI</em> being the identifier of a resource, and <em>MediaType</em> indicating the format of the content in <em>Body</em>.</p>

              <p id="linked-data-platform"><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Platform">LDP</abbr>) is a RESTful read-write API for Web resources, which can group related resources together into constructs known as <q>Containers</q>. It uses the RDF data model the describe the state of RDF and non-RDF resources. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-ucr/">Linked Data Platform Use Cases and Requirements</a></cite> outlines a wide-range of user stories, use cases, scenarios, and requirements which was used as the bases for the LDP specification.</p>

              <p id="hydra-core-vocabulary"><cite><a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/">Hydra</a></cite> is a vocabulary to enable the creation of hypermedia-driven Web APIs by enabling a server to advertise affordances of its resources - machine-readable valid state transitions - to a client. A client uses this information to construct HTTP requests in order to perform possible read-write operations. Hydra enables generic client applications to be built without hardcoding knowledge about the available operations against Web APIs.</p>

              <p id="linked-data-fragments"><cite><a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org/">Linked Data Fragments</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Fragments">LDF</abbr>) is the concept of having a uniform view on Linked Data interfaces that can be used towards reliable Web querying. To that end, a client asks a server about the kinds of Linked Data fragments that are available and then dynamically adapts its query plan for the server to execute. A Linked Data fragment is defined by three characteristics: data (what triples does it contain?), metadata (what do we know abut it?), controls (how to access more data?).</p>

              <p id="triple-pattern-fragments"><cite><a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/triple-pattern-fragments/">Triple Pattern Fragments</a></cite> (<abbr title="Triple Pattern Fragments">TPF</abbr>) is one possible way for a server to define a Linked Data fragment that enable live querying over the dataset on the client-side. TPF's hypermedia controls are expressed using the Hydra vocabulary.</p>

              <p id="linked-data-templates"><cite><a href="https://atomgraph.github.io/Linked-Data-Templates/">Linked Data Templates</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Templates">LDT</abbr>) provides the means to define read-write Linked Data APIs declaratively using SPARQL and specify a uniform interaction protocol for them.</p>

              <!-- <p id="rdforms"></p> -->

              <p>The design pattern for these Linked Data centric read-write architectures can be categorised as follows:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>the ability to perform CRUD interactions against Web resources</li>
                <li>decoupling software from domain or application-specific operations and data</li>
                <li>declarative and machine-readable affordances for valid read-write operations</li>

              <p>Tim Berners-Lee outlines two issues for the persistence of HTTP URIs:</p>

              <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/PersistentDomains">
                <ol>
                  <li>The persistence of the opaque string which follows the domain name, and</li>
                  <li>the persistence of the domain name  itself.</li>

              <p>In a long enough timeline, .. more of a promise. URIs are not inherently persistent but persistable.</p>
              <p>Perseverance on Persistence ( https://www.slideshare.net/hvdsomp/perseverance-on-persistence/ ): "what it would take to be able to persistently, precisely, and seamlessly revisit the web of the past" - hvdsomp</p>
              <p>"Ultimately URI registration is a social agreement. URI owners declare a policy eg. implicit, written, verbal. If you announce a policy for your URIs eg. what happens in 1000 years, that says something about its intentions/reuse. Just as w3id, doi. Trust is built from there." - csarven</p>
              <p>Publish (make public) archiving and permanence policies.. degree of accountability</p>
              <p><abbr title="Persistent Identifier">PID</abbr>, DOI, w3id, PURL</p>

              <p class="todo">The relevance of this section/work is about independent publishing (different jurisdictions) but following same line of Web standards / interop... pay-as-you-go... the sum is greater</p>

              <p>This article describes the semantic structure and linking of the W3C Recommendation <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> (LDN), its test suite, and implementation reports.</p>

              <p>Semantically interlinking and detailed machine-readability of components related to Web standards and their implementations is novel, and can be useful for coherently documenting software projects and their conformance with specifications. Everything presented here is open source and reusable by other specifications (W3C standards or not), test suites, and implementations.</p>

              <p>As a concrete example of the benefits of this approach, the LDN test suite is itself an LDN implementation for the purpose of automating the collection and aggregation of implementation reports which were used directly towards the formal standardisation process.</p>

              <p>The Webâ€™s design stands out because of its absence of centralised control, both for technical reasons of scalability and resilience as well as a societal need for freedom of expression. A challenge in such large-scale decentralised networks is how related publications can be semantically interlinked, even if they are authored and published by different parties. Centralising their publications is practiced by the majority of authoring networks today, demanding authors to give up some or all of their control in exchange for technical simplicity.</p>

              <p>dokieli shows it is possible to build a social machine wherein people interact with each other without the need of centralised coordination. Users can choose storage space for their content independently of the applications with which they edit and view that content. Documents are connected statically through links and dynamically through Linked Data Notifications. This is a proof for the viability of a decentralised authoring and annotation environment built with Web standards.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, dokieliâ€™s use of standards shows that dokieli itself is only one means to an end: once the document has been created, it lives on independently. The social machine consists of people and documents, connected by Web standards, with dokieli acting as just one possible catalyst. Different Web applications can incorporate any of dokieliâ€™s functions and implement the principles to varying extents. Since the data is loosely coupled to the application, we avoid the <em>walled garden</em> problem of many current social platforms today.</p>

              <p>A couple of important socio-technical challenges remain. Resources might want to indicate in a granular way which actions they support or encourage, such as liking, bookmarking, or sharing, and perhaps conditions about which notifications should be sent when any of these events take place. In order to encourage positive behaviour, we might want ways to provide moderation, and solutions to prevent harassment and abuse. Closely related is the issue of identity, pseudonymity and anonymity, and its relation with trust and verification. While there is likely no final solution to these issues in an open ecosystem, it is worthwhile exploring within dokieli or other tools based on similar design principles.</p>

              <p>Future work can examine how additional features can be realised on top of existing Web standards, or where more development is required. Real-time collaborative editing is often realised with centralised communication (even though some peer to peer alternatives exist). Services like top-down annotations or automated entity marking can improve the discoverability of a publication, yet the question of how to offer these without being tied to certain servers needs to be still solved.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>The future of self-registration of scholarly units depends in large part on how well its practitioners, advocates, educators alike, are able to reconcile the ideals that the medium offers with the realities of the commercial third-party systems within which scholarly communication operates and the homogenizing influences of scholarly socialisation.</p>

              <p>While these challenges are technically surmountable, they need to be taken seriously if, the extreme case where "anyone can say anything about anything" is subject to be treated on equal grounds as a piece of information that is well certified. One contemporary and popular example of this scenario is where nearly all scientists being in agreement on the presence of global warming, climate change, and its consequences. In order to honour a commitment to public service, scientific communication - independent to self-registration - must remain grounded on reproducible and/or replicable facts and explanations, attributable and accountable participants. After all, the output affects journalism, further scientific knowledge exchange, policy making, as well public opinion and perception.</p>

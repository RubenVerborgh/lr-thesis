              <p>The term <q>information society</q> is used to loosely denote increasingly central role of information and communication technologies in social and economic activity. With the advent of the Internet and the Web, the production, distribution, and consumption of instantaneously accessible networked knowledge has further shaped social policies and practices around the world.</p>

              <p>As discussed earlier, throughout history, the complex connections between communication technologies and society transformed control structures of civilisations. Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan argued that electronic media, unlike any other, compressed time and space - creating a <q>global village</q> - as well as facilitating the influence and potential of centralised control. While the Internet reinforces democratic (re)distribution of communicative power, and that the Web is inherently decentralised - with the exception of centralised notion of DNS tied to social agreements - today, centralisation of all forms of information exchange and various forms of (algorithmic) censorship - state or self-imposed - is commonplace; from governments, social media services, to increasingly various and variety of large-scale systems that collect, adopt, organise, and share data in diverse sectors. For instance, major information organisations like Google, Facebook, Elsevier, to a long tail of (social) media services, exert a great influence on how and what information can be accessible, expressible, reusable, with respect to the cost of human capital, as well as impact on society by creating information and <q>filter bubbles</q>. In essence knowledge elitism takes different shapes and forms on society. Information control tends to happen through system designs that are inherently centralised.</p>

              <p>The information needs of an individual, community, and society vary from personal, local to global. For instance, an individual can expect to participate in exchanging knowledge and goods autonomously. Given access to the Internet and the Web, researchers can register and control their URI space; personal data storage and applications; as well as social scholarly activity without intermediaries. Scientific communities can make their discoveries available in the global commons; take part in reproducing and replicating others' findings; be involved in quality-control and certification processes, and interact with participants and information. Given these activities, the output for the society is a democratic knowledge exchange at the global level.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>Given our half a millennia of experience on mass print publishing, and a half century on electronic publishing, we are in a position to situate, examine and question our assumptions as to what constitutes scholarly knowledge exchange and participation in context of the Web. For instance, the Web inherently enables anyone to be a "publisher" while each researcher can exercise their full creativity without being subject to arbitrary constraints. Any third-party involvement is fundamentally subject to conflict with that notion. Yet, this third-party involvement, typically through for-profit services injunction with academic institutions, influence the quality and availability of publicly-funded research output and exchange. The social and professional incentives for academics can be traced to the workflows exerted by external forces, such as for-profit third-parties.</p>

              <p>If scholarly communication is predominately and increasingly driven by the Web, how can we approach to integrate scholarly affairs with the inherent properties of the Web? One way to look at this is by examining history: the printing press played a major role in moving the non-literate public to learn to read and write for themselves. Given the Web, we find ourselves in a similar situation, with different modes of communication. In order to use the Web effectively - as far as taking advantage of its built-in characteristics, the research community essentially needs to better position itself to self-publish and disseminate their knowledge, as well as be more attributable and accountable in their social engagement. This kind of ongoing (r)evolution is vital for the advancement of scholarly communication; unchaining itself from antiquated and inadequate practices, towards actual and complete Web-centric information flows and participations, in order to better aid societal advancement.</p>

              <p>I postulate that the knowledge creators and participants can objectively demonstrate that self-publishing of different units of communication can be socially, technically, and financially preferable to a third-party's handling of the same information and interactions, as well as their reuse.</p>

              <p>Let us now first turn our attention to the technicalities of this matter given available media at hand.</p>

              <p>This article describes the semantic structure and linking of the W3C Recommendation <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> (LDN), its test suite, and implementation reports.</p>

              <p>Semantically interlinking and detailed machine-readability of components related to Web standards and their implementations is novel, and can be useful for coherently documenting software projects and their conformance with specifications. Everything presented here is open source and reusable by other specifications (W3C standards or not), test suites, and implementations.</p>

              <p>As a concrete example of the benefits of this approach, the LDN test suite is itself an LDN implementation for the purpose of automating the collection and aggregation of implementation reports which were used directly towards the formal standardisation process.</p>

              <p>The future of self-registration of scholarly units depends in large part on how well its practitioners, advocates, educators alike, are able to reconcile the ideals that the medium offers with the realities of the commercial third-party systems within which scholarly communication operates and the homogenizing influences of scholarly socialisation.</p>

              <p>While these challenges are technically surmountable, they need to be taken seriously if, the extreme case where "anyone can say anything about anything" is subject to be treated on equal grounds as a piece of information that is well certified. One contemporary and popular example of this scenario is where nearly all scientists being in agreement on the presence of global warming, climate change, and its consequences. In order to honour a commitment to public service, scientific communication - independent to self-registration - must remain grounded on reproducible and/or replicable facts and explanations, attributable and accountable participants. After all, the output affects journalism, further scientific knowledge exchange, policy making, as well public opinion and perception.</p>

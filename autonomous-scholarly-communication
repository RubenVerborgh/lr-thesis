              <p>The term <q>information society</q> is used to loosely denote increasingly central role of information and communication technologies in social and economic activity. With the advent of the Internet and the Web, the production, distribution, and consumption of instantaneously accessible networked knowledge has further shaped social policies and practices around the world.</p>

              <p>As discussed earlier, throughout history, the complex connections between communication technologies and society transformed control structures of civilisations. Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan argued that electronic media, unlike any other, compressed time and space - creating a <q>global village</q> - as well as facilitating the influence and potential of centralised control. While the Internet reinforces democratic (re)distribution of communicative power, and that the Web is inherently decentralised - with the exception of centralised notion of DNS tied to social agreements - today, centralisation of all forms of information exchange and various forms of (algorithmic) censorship - state or self-imposed - is commonplace; from governments, social media services, to increasingly various and variety of large-scale systems that collect, adopt, organise, and share data in diverse sectors. For instance, major information organisations like Google, Facebook, Elsevier, to a long tail of (social) media services, exert a great influence on how and what information can be accessible, expressible, reusable, with respect to the cost of human capital, as well as impact on society by creating information and <q>filter bubbles</q>. In essence knowledge elitism takes different shapes and forms on society. Information control tends to happen through system designs that are inherently centralised.</p>

              <p>The information needs of an individual, community, and society vary from personal, local, to global. For instance, an individual can expect to participate in exchanging knowledge and goods autonomously. Given access to the Internet and the Web, researchers can register and control their URI space; personal data storage and applications; as well as social scholarly activity without intermediaries. Scientific communities can make their discoveries available in the global commons; take part in reproducing and replicating others' findings; be involved in quality-control and certification processes, and interact with participants and information. Given these activities, the output for the society is a democratic knowledge exchange at the global level.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p about="" id="problem-statement" rel="schema:hasPart"><span about="#problem-statement" property="schema:description" typeof="deo:ProblemStatement">While the Web was originally conceived as a decentralised <em>application</em> running on the Internet, where every organisation and individual can participate, it became increasingly centralised with <a class="todo" href="https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/">less than 1% of the servers serving more than 99% of the content</a>. The domination of centralisation is essentially due to economic and state incentives, and it has shaped the technical infrastructure: it is currently much easier and more efficient to author, manage, publish, and search large amounts of similarly structured content using a centralised platform. Blogger, YouTube and Facebook, for example, are centralised authoring, publishing, and search platforms for blog posts, videos or social network content respectively.</span></p>

              <p>However, independence of centralised platforms is a necessity for ownership of published ideas, and to establish a relation of trust. For example, Facebook has been accused of <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/05/yes_facebook_is_biased_now_it_should_admit_it.html">bias</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth">false information</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/facebook-vietnam-war-photo-nudity.html">censorship</a>â€”but rather than blaming this on any particular platform, we identify it as an unavoidable result of centralisation. After all, there is a continued tension between unrestricted publication rights on the one hand, and a guarantee of balanced, verified information on the other. In a fully decentralised setting, each source is filterless and responsible for its own quality and reputation, while others are free to selectively (dis-)trust certain sources using any mechanism they desire.</p>

              <p>Decentralised authoring, publication, and annotation furthermore have the potential to impact areas in which centralisation currently determines the pace of evolution. Scientific publishing, for instance, is often bound to centralised review and dissemination processes. Instead, rigorous scientific discourse could be realised with an open, decentralised environment for the annotation of manuscripts, which has the potential to engage more people sooner. Trust then no longer stems from a finite process with limited transparency, but is rather continuously assessed by repeated independent validation. Publication thereby becomes the starting point rather than the end point.</p>

              <p>If we want to strengthen the decentralised nature of the Web again, we need to develop technologies to simplify the decentralised authoring, management, exploration, and search of Web content.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>Given our half a millennia of experience on mass print publishing, and a half century on electronic publishing, we are in a position to situate, examine and question our assumptions as to what constitutes scholarly knowledge exchange and participation in context of the Web. For instance, the Web - a <em>read-write</em> space - inherently enables anyone to be a "publisher" while each researcher can exercise their full creativity without being subject to arbitrary constraints. Any third-party involvement is fundamentally subject to conflict with that notion. Yet, third-party involvement, typically through for-profit service providers injunction with academic institutions and libraries, influence the quality and availability of publicly-funded research output and exchange. The social and professional incentives for academics can be traced to the workflows exerted by external forces.</p>

              <p>If scholarly communication is predominately and increasingly driven by the Web, how can we approach to integrate scholarly affairs with the inherent properties of the Web? One way to look at this is by examining history: the printing press played a major role in moving the non-literate public to learn to read and write for themselves. Given the Web, we find ourselves in a similar situation, with different modes of communication. In order to use the Web effectively - as far as taking advantage of its built-in characteristics, the research community essentially needs to better position itself to self-publish and disseminate their knowledge, as well as be more attributable and accountable in their social engagement. This kind of ongoing (r)evolution is vital for the advancement of scholarly communication; unchaining itself from antiquated and inadequate practices, towards actual and complete Web-centric information flows and participations, in order to better aid societal advancement.</p>

              <p>The notion of <q>control yourself</q> can postulate that the knowledge creators and participants can objectively demonstrate that self-publishing of different units of communication can be socially, technically, and financially preferable to a third-party's handling of the same information and interactions, as well as their reuse. It opens up the possibility for autonomous (decentralised) participation, enabling universally accessible units that are human and machine-readable, as well as socially aware interactions.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>Let us now turn our attention to the technicalities of this matter given the possibilities in the environment that the Web offers, and the feasibility of using certain Web standards and technologies to address certain kinds of challenges in scholarly communication. Due to the nature of current Web applications and services, users (including researchers) do not particularly have free choice or ability to store their documents at locations of their choosing without compromising ownership and access control, and as an effect their privacy and security. This is at the root of <em>information silos</em> that are ultimately controlled by third-party which results in systems designs that are either incapable of or have friction with importing or exporting data, as well as interactions based on interoperable open Web standards and practices. We focus on two areas of centralisation that are at the forefront of the way scholarly communication is conducted on the Web and its ramifications on the rest of the sociotechnical system:</p>

              <ul type="lower-roman">
                <li>data</li>
                <li>application</li>
              </ul>

              <p>While centralisation of data and application are two distinct areas of concern, some of the challenges we face in scholarly communication make them appear as one. They are typically lumped into one pre-packaged process. For instance, when we discuss challenges and issues in access to knowledge, it is not strictly about where data is available from, whether we can or how to obtain the data, or what is its quality (like formats and their affordances) and so forth, but equally about which applications (including communication standards and services) that <em>both</em> humans and machines are required to use or conform to in order to obtain data. Similarly, being required to use a particular set of applications (tools to format articles, services to create an account at, and the terms to agree with) in order to share research artefacts with, equally impose a certain set of characteristics that some data can have, and what happens to the data once we share it with other entities.</p>

              <p>Data and application appear to be intertwined because the workflows that the researchers are required to use tend to be unique and propriety designs are predominantly enforced by third-parties. While some of the differences in designs may be due to historical reasons or technical debt - as a by-product - they also ensure various forms of vendor lock-in on the data and the applications to obtain, create, share or reuse them. The use of non-interoperable (or even post-facto) methods to create and exchange data on the Web leads to the fragmentation of data through silo-services, and along with it the dependency on applications having their interaction mechanisms established via out-of-band knowledge; requiring humans part of the equation at each step. For example, if we strictly focus on the quality of machine-interpretability of scholarly information on the Web, the technical obstacles are evident and ample. The applications for the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Latin phrase meaning the existing state of affairs">status quo</span> need to be continuously hard-wired to know what to look for; what to do with or how to handle once something of interest is found; or where to go next in the discovery phase. Similarly, automating discovery; searching and finding, of fine-grained information without human interference is still central to the limitations. Regardless of the technical imperfections, these designs are gains for businesses as they can impose their own set of requirements on their users, and control over data.</p>

              <p>We turn our attention to resolving data and application-based centralisation that are predominantly adopted by third-party (for-profit) companies - often monopolies - for certain Web services, by adopting Web-centric worfklows that are inherently interoperable by design, eg. decentralised and social on the Web, but most importantly enabling the creators and the users of data and applications to be truly autonomous entities. Hence, we strive towards neutrality and democratisation of scholarly knowledge on all levels of access for humans and machines; and decentralisation and decoupling of data and applications while addressing some of the infrastructure limitations and needs in order to conduct genuine scholarly communication on the Web.</p>

            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
              <p id="internet-web-protocols">The foundational communication and transfer protocols of the Internet and the Web (eg. <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>/<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>, <abbr title="Domain Name Server">DNS</abbr>, <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>) are designed to operate in a decentralised and distributed manner. In terms of global functionality, removing a single node from the network - a machine with an IP address - does not halt the whole network. Similarly, when an HTTP URL is no longer available (eg. typical "404 Not Found", "410 Gone" status messages), the other URLs are not affected. This particular behaviour, where the Web being functional without requiring bi-directional hyperlinks is considered to be a "feature" (rather than a "bug") of the overall system. However, Ted Nelson disputes this design choice with respect to the original Hypertext design.</p>

              <p id="read-write-web">As discussed previously the <abbr title="Architecture of the World Wide Web">AWWW</abbr> enables the identification, discovery and description of information for the notion of a <q>Read-Write Web</q> where servers and clients interact using Web standards. Generally speaking <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">create, read, update and delete</a></cite> (<abbr title="Create, Read, Update and Delete">CRUD</abbr>) are the basic functions of persistent storage as well as conventions for user-interfaces to view and change information. Each CRUD operation can be mapped to an interaction method of the Web architecture. For example, the request function for HTTP would be: <math alttext="upper R e q u e s t equals upper M e t h o d vector-or-cross-product upper I upper R upper I vector-or-cross-product upper M e d i a upper T y p e vector-or-cross-product upper B o d y" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>Request</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>Method</mi><mo>â¨¯</mo><mi>IRI</mi><mo>â¨¯</mo><mi>MediaType</mi><mo>â¨¯</mo><mi>Body</mi></mrow></math>, where <em>create</em> would map to HTTP method(s) <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>; <em>read</em> (retrieve) to <code>GET</code>; <em>update</em> (modify) to <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PATCH</code>; and <em>delete</em> (destroy) to <code>DELETE</code>, and <em>IRI</em> being the identifier of a resource, and <em>MediaType</em> indicating the format of the content in <em>Body</em>.</p>

              <p id="socially-aware-read-write-linked-data">In <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/CloudStorage">Socially Aware Cloud Storage</a></cite> and <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/ReadWriteLinkedData">Read-Write Linked Data</a></cite>, Berners-Lee discusses where the Web architecture together with existing or future communication protocols and data standards can be used to materialise a <q>socially-aware decentralized access control of reading and of writing to linked data, and of notification of changes.</q> The overarching goal is to enable people and software to both create and to co-create information, and as well as to interact with information using social applications. This is all meanwhile technically and legally enabling participants to retain their autonomy; identity and storage, access and rights over their contributions. In order to achieve this, one of the goals is to make and stimulate an infrastructure where data and applications interacting with such data are decoupled by design. That is, our ability to work with linked data without any constraints on which applications that can be used provided that they follow consensus based open protocols and data models. At the core of this initiative is where users, groups, and applications use global identifiers (URIs), and the capabilities of the storage are access controlled using policies assigned to those identifiers - "socially-aware" - as well appropriate use of the data based on their rights and responsibilities. This also leads to the commodification of read-write data storage - whereby their location on the Web can be decided by its owners and contributors - and the independence of applications interacting with it.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>The following are a selection of open Web specifications; standards and practices that are designed with the notion of decentralisation, interoperability, and extensibility. The are based on use cases that facilitate discovery, read-write operations of interlinked Web resources. Their core functions are listed in context of the forces in scientific communication in Table [].</p>

              <p id="linked-data-platform"><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Platform">LDP</abbr>) specifies a RESTful read-write protocol and vocabulary for Web resources. LDP has distinct notions for <q>resource</q> and <q>container</q>; where the container construct can group and manage resources. LDP uses the RDF data model to describe the state of RDF and non-RDF resources. <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-ucr/">Linked Data Platform Use Cases and Requirements</a></cite> outlines a wide-range of user stories, use cases, scenarios, and requirements which was used as the bases for the LDP specification. LDP can be used to mimic a file system abstraction interacting with Web resources over HTTP. The <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-paging/">LDP Paging</a></cite> mechanism can be used by clients and servers to efficiently request and serve a resource description, eg. resources in a container, in multiple parts. All LDP servers and clients can interact with each other using the same HTTP interface in context of Linked Data to perform CRUD operations.</p>

              <p id="hydra-core-vocabulary"><cite><a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/">Hydra</a></cite> is a vocabulary to enable the creation of hypermedia-driven Web APIs by enabling a server to advertise affordances of its resources - machine-readable valid state transitions - to a client. A client uses this information to construct HTTP requests in order to perform possible read-write operations. Hydra enables generic client applications to be built without hardcoding knowledge about the available operations against Web APIs.</p>

              <p id="linked-data-fragments"><cite><a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org/">Linked Data Fragments</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Fragments">LDF</abbr>) is the concept of having a uniform view on Linked Data interfaces that can be used towards reliable Web querying. To that end, a client asks a server about the kinds of Linked Data fragments that are available and then dynamically adapts its query plan for the server to execute. A Linked Data fragment is defined by three characteristics: data (what triples does it contain?), metadata (what do we know abut it?), controls (how to access more data?).</p>

              <p id="triple-pattern-fragments"><cite><a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/triple-pattern-fragments/">Triple Pattern Fragments</a></cite> (<abbr title="Triple Pattern Fragments">TPF</abbr>) is one possible way for a server to define a Linked Data fragment that enable live querying over the dataset on the client-side. TPF's hypermedia controls are expressed using the Hydra vocabulary.</p>

              <p id="linked-data-templates"><cite><a href="https://atomgraph.github.io/Linked-Data-Templates/">Linked Data Templates</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Templates">LDT</abbr>) provides the means to define read-write Linked Data APIs declaratively using SPARQL and specify a uniform interaction protocol for them. An LDT based server applies re-usable RDF ontologies to define application structure declaratively as a set of instructions for resource representation processing. To this end, "templating" is where an HTTP operation is mapped to a certain URI pattern that a server executes a SPARQL command in order to drive RDF CRUD processing. When a client triggers a particular request pattern, the server gives a suitable response based on available templates that are identified with URIs.</p>

              <p id="rdf-post"><cite><a href="http://www.lsrn.org/semweb/rdfpost.html">RDF/POST Encoding for RDF</a></cite> uses the W3C HTML 4.01 Recommendation to specify read-write operations of RDF data through form-encoded RDF serialisation. Read operations are done by having an RDF/POST document encoded in HTTP GET URL, and write operations are sent via HTTP POST with form-urlencoded media type.</p>

              <p id="fedora-api"><cite><a href="https://fcrepo.github.io/fcrepo-specification/">Fedora API Specification</a></cite> refines the semantics and interaction patterns of the LDP specification in order to address the needs of repositories for durable access to digital data. Its goal is to facilitate interoperability with client applications. While the interactions patterns provides a mechanism for different client applications to communicate with servers, servers can be expected to vary in the kinds of services and affordances they offer for their resources. Fedora uses LDP as a foundation and defines the version identification and navigation scheme with respect to the Memento specification, integrates resource authorization and Web Access Control rules, provides a design for the publication of event notifications, and interaction patterns to support binary resource fixity verification.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>The design pattern for these Linked Data centric read-write architectures can be categorised as follows:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>the ability to perform CRUD interactions against Web resources</li>
                <li>decoupling software from domain or application-specific operations and data</li>
                <li>declarative and machine-readable affordances for valid read-write operations</li>
              </ul>

              <p id="memento"><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089">HTTP Framework for Time-Based Access to Resource States -- Memento</a></cite> (<abbr title="HTTP Framework for Time-Based Access to Resource States -- Memento">Memento</abbr>): introduces a uniform, datetime-based, version access capability that integrates present and past Web resources. As representations of resources change over time, there is a need to preserve (archive and version) earlier representations. One common resource versioning pattern on the Web consists of generic URIs referring to the latest version of an accessible resource, as well as having a dedicated version URI for each resource. The Memento framework facilitates the discovery and retrieval of distributed versioned resources with datetime negotiation, a variant of content-negotiation; and TimeMaps an index of URIs referring to the prior states of a resource. The framework also helps to recognise frozen states of resources - a promise that the resource state has not and will not change.</p>

              <p id="web-annotation"><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/annotation/">Web Annotation</a></cite> (<abbr title="Web Annotation">WA</abbr>) is set of specifications for an interoperable, sharable, distributed Web Annotation architecture. The annotations convey information about a resource or associations between resources to meet different motivations and purposes, eg. assessing, replying, describing, bookmarking, as well as <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#abstract">linking arbitrary content to a particular data point or to segments of timed multimedia resources</q>. The Recommendations and Notes include:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">Web Annotation Data Model</a></cite> describes the underlying annotation <em>abstract</em> data model as well as a JSON-LD serialization.</li>
                <li><cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/">Web Annotation Vocabulary</a></cite> provides the vocabulary which underpins the annotation data model.</li>
                <li><cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/">Web Annotation Protocol</a></cite> is the HTTP API for publishing, syndicating, and distributing Web Annotations. Much of the protocol is based on using and extending LDP and REST best practices.</li>
                <li><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-html/">Embedding Web Annotations in HTML</a></cite> describes and illustrates potential approaches for including annotations within HTML documents using current specifications like RDFa or JSON-LD.</li>

              <p id="linked-data-notifications"><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> (<abbr title="Linked Data Notifications">LDN</abbr>) is a resource-centric communication protocol for applications to generate notifications about activities, interactions, and new information, which may be presented to the user or processed further. It allows any resource (target) to advertise a receiving endpoint (inbox) for the messages anywhere on the Web. The server (receiver) hosting the inbox can have messages pushed to them by applications (sender), as well as how other applications (consumer) may retrieve those messages. Each notification in an inbox is an identifiable and reusable unit (URI), and can contain any data using any vocabulary.</p>

              <p id="activitypub"><cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a></cite> (<abbr title="ActivityPub">AP</abbr>) is a decentralized social networking protocol based upon the Activity Streams 2.0 data format. It provides a client to server API for CRUD operations, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering notifications and content. User accounts on servers have an inbox (to receive messages from the world), and an outbox (to send messages to others). AP's inbox property is the same as LDN's, and the targeting and delivery mechanism can be interoperably combined.</p>

              <p>Different types of strings, eg. a username, an email address, an RSA public key, a URI, can be used to directly or indirectly identify agents. While each can be useful within their own context, Web-based identifiers (URI) make it possible to provide machine-readable descriptions when dereferenced, descriptions being extensible by their owners, as well as being interoperable global identifiers that can be interlinked unambiguously with other things.</p>

A WebID is an HTTP URI denoting an agent, for example a person, organisation, or software. It can be used towards: the declaration of an agent's existence; discovery, describing or reference; authentication; and authorisation. WebID is distributed and decentralised in that any agent can be <em>named</em> anywhere on the Web under the jurisdiction of the URI owner. It is extensible in that it can be used injunction with secure authentication and access control mechanism, as well as having dereferenceable machine-readable descriptions which are themselves extensible. WebID can improve privacy and security and control over how each agent can identify themselves in order to allow fine grained access control to their information on the Web.</p>

A public key cryptographic system uses a pair of keys: public keys (disseminated openly) and private keys (withheld by the owner). It has two main functions: authentication and encryption. For authentication, public key verifies that a holder of the paired private key sent the message. In the case of encryption, for example, when Guinan wants to send Picard a message, Guinan takes Picard's public key to encrypt a message where only Picard can decrypt the message with his private key. WoT essentially leaves trust decisions to the users, as opposed to a centralised mechanism with overarching authority.</p>

              <p id="robust-links"><cite><a href="http://robustlinks.mementoweb.org/spec/">Robust Links</a></cite>: are human and machine-actionable approaches to <q>decorate</q> links in hypertext documents so that the context of linked resources is preserved at the time of linking. Given that content-drift and link-rot pose challenges to maintain context and integrity between resources in a long enough time line, associating the datetime information when linking helps to retain such context. The datetime information can be accompanied with a snapshot of the target URI made at a Web archive or a versioning system when linking, and using either the original or the versioned resource as the primary reference. Including datetime information in the source document can make it possible to interpret the context of each of the links in the document and to discover relevant snapshots. In the event that a linked resource or a snapshot becomes inaccessible, the datetime information helps to discover temporally close alternative snapshots.</p>

              <p class="todo">The relevance of this section/work is about independent publishing (different jurisdictions) but following same line of Web standards / interop... pay-as-you-go... the sum is greater</p>

              <p>This article describes the semantic structure and linking of the W3C Recommendation <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/">Linked Data Notifications</a></cite> (LDN), its test suite, and implementation reports.</p>

              <p>Semantically interlinking and detailed machine-readability of components related to Web standards and their implementations is novel, and can be useful for coherently documenting software projects and their conformance with specifications. Everything presented here is open source and reusable by other specifications (W3C standards or not), test suites, and implementations.</p>

              <p>As a concrete example of the benefits of this approach, the LDN test suite is itself an LDN implementation for the purpose of automating the collection and aggregation of implementation reports which were used directly towards the formal standardisation process.</p>

              <p>The Webâ€™s design stands out because of its absence of centralised control, both for technical reasons of scalability and resilience as well as a societal need for freedom of expression. A challenge in such large-scale decentralised networks is how related publications can be semantically interlinked, even if they are authored and published by different parties. Centralising their publications is practiced by the majority of authoring networks today, demanding authors to give up some or all of their control in exchange for technical simplicity.</p>

              <p>dokieli shows it is possible to build a social machine wherein people interact with each other without the need of centralised coordination. Users can choose storage space for their content independently of the applications with which they edit and view that content. Documents are connected statically through links and dynamically through Linked Data Notifications. This is a proof for the viability of a decentralised authoring and annotation environment built with Web standards.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, dokieliâ€™s use of standards shows that dokieli itself is only one means to an end: once the document has been created, it lives on independently. The social machine consists of people and documents, connected by Web standards, with dokieli acting as just one possible catalyst. Different Web applications can incorporate any of dokieliâ€™s functions and implement the principles to varying extents. Since the data is loosely coupled to the application, we avoid the <em>walled garden</em> problem of many current social platforms today.</p>

              <p>A couple of important socio-technical challenges remain. Resources might want to indicate in a granular way which actions they support or encourage, such as liking, bookmarking, or sharing, and perhaps conditions about which notifications should be sent when any of these events take place. In order to encourage positive behaviour, we might want ways to provide moderation, and solutions to prevent harassment and abuse. Closely related is the issue of identity, pseudonymity and anonymity, and its relation with trust and verification. While there is likely no final solution to these issues in an open ecosystem, it is worthwhile exploring within dokieli or other tools based on similar design principles.</p>

              <p>Future work can examine how additional features can be realised on top of existing Web standards, or where more development is required. Real-time collaborative editing is often realised with centralised communication (even though some peer to peer alternatives exist). Services like top-down annotations or automated entity marking can improve the discoverability of a publication, yet the question of how to offer these without being tied to certain servers needs to be still solved.</p>

              <hr />

              <p>The future of self-registration of scholarly units depends in large part on how well its practitioners, advocates, educators alike, are able to reconcile the ideals that the medium offers with the realities of the commercial third-party systems within which scholarly communication operates and the homogenizing influences of scholarly socialisation.</p>

              <p>While these challenges are technically surmountable, they need to be taken seriously if, the extreme case where "anyone can say anything about anything" is subject to be treated on equal grounds as a piece of information that is well certified. One contemporary and popular example of this scenario is where nearly all scientists being in agreement on the presence of global warming, climate change, and its consequences. In order to honour a commitment to public service, scientific communication - independent to self-registration - must remain grounded on reproducible and/or replicable facts and explanations, attributable and accountable participants. After all, the output affects journalism, further scientific knowledge exchange, policy making, as well public opinion and perception.</p>
